       "u'The two worlds have collided, and the disparate timelines have merged. Now, all that remains is for our heroes to find a way to defeat the all-powerful Human B and escape Smart Earth with their lives and memories intact. Tall order? Maybe. But this group of loyal, stubborn friends have stuck to their guns through years of loneliness and oppression. Now that they\\u2019re together, nothing will stop them from giving the evil corporation running Smart Earth a run for their money.  FINAL EPISODE RECAP  Running from Professor Park and his goons, Woo-jin comes out of the woods and stumbles straight into the path of an oncoming car. It hits him at high speed, and he goes hurtling through the air before falling hard on the asphalt. As blood pools under his head, he reaches toward the broken star as he thinks of his brother and Jung-yeon. The alien cube that powered the device dims as the life ebbs out of Woo-jin. Sometime later, Woo-jin lies in a coma in a hospital room, the cube in a glass box on the side table. Professor Park stares at his unmoving body, while Sunbae Lee sits by the door with his head clasped in his hands. The surgeon who operated on Bum-gyun and Min-young arrives and tells the professor that it\\u2019s uncertain whether either will wake up any time soon, or if they will even retain their memories.  Min-young wakes up though, and the first person she asks about is Bum-gyun. Chief Hong takes her to the boy and tells her that they don\\u2019t know when or if he will ever wake up. Leaving her by Bum-gyun\\u2019s side, Chief Hong emerges from the room and receives an email from Woo-jin. In it, Woo-jin tells Chief Hong to give Bum-gyun the memory footage stored in a hard drive, in case he doesn\\u2019t regain his own. Chief Hong finds the external hard drive in Woo-jin\\u2019s backpack and tries to call Woo-jin, only to hear his voicemail. Just then, Chief Hong gets a call from his superior telling him that he\\u2019s been transferred to the Cyber Crimes Unit.  Min-young runs out of the hospital room and says that she also just received a pre-scheduled email from Woo-jin that told her he wouldn\\u2019t be able to return. \\u201cI feel like something bad happened to Woo-jin,\\u201d Chief Hong concludes worriedly. Jung-yeon gets to a safe place and plugs in her phone to her laptop. Going through the images on her phone, she comes across the one she and Woo-jin had laughed over. Remembering how she\\u2019d told him to smile more, Jung-yeon tears up in the present. Suddenly, an email notification pops up, and Jung-yeon gets her own pre-scheduled email from Woo-jin. In it is another video of Woo-jin, but this time, he says that if he isn\\u2019t back by now, then his plan must have failed. He tells her to hide and never look for him.  Even as Jung-yeon shakes her head, Woo-jin says he knows that it would go against the grain for her. But he adds that if she doesn\\u2019t protect herself, then she would be wasting his sacrifice as well as Byul\\u2019s. As tears stream down Jung-yeon\\u2019s face, Video Woo-jin tells her that he\\u2019ll definitely come back to her and Bum-gyun \\u2014 it\\u2019ll just take him a little longer than he\\u2019d expected. \\u201cWait just a little bit longer,\\u201d Woo-jin says, adding a small, reassuring smile. We return to 2037, and to the scene that ended the last episode as Woo-jin remembers what he\\u2019d said to Bum-gyun back in the hospital room: \\u201cHyung, I\\u2019m scared. I\\u2019ll.. be back.\\u201d  With tears streaming down his face, Joon-hyuk asks if Woo-jin was leaving to meet Professor Park when he said those words to him. \\u201cWere you going to trade my surgery for dad\\u2019s research? Is that what you were scared of?\\u201d Joon-hyuk asks. Sobbing with grief, Joon-hyuk apologizes for letting Woo-jin go alone and pulls his little brother into a hug. While Woo-jin resists at first, still believing himself to be a clone, his face crumples up as he hugs Joon-hyuk back. Dong-soo runs into the church and tells everyone that Joon-hyuk and Woo-jin are nowhere to  be found. He wonders if Joon-hyuk could have done something to Woo-jin, which makes Jung-yeon run out to look for them.  While everyone else panics inside, the two brothers are busy catching up on a bench outside. Joon-hyuk tells Woo-jin that he\\u2019s forty-one years old now and rues that he wasted his youth looking for his younger sibling. Narrowing his eyes, Woo-jin wonders if his brother still hasn\\u2019t ever dated anyone. Joon-hyuk sputters, then points out that Woo-jin hasn\\u2019t, either. (Ha. I think Woo-jin has a better excuse though.)  Jung-yeon finds them at the bench and sighs in relief as the two turn to her with smiling faces. Joon-hyuk slings his arm around his little brother and familiarly tousles his hair while Jung-yeon looks on, smiling. Aw. The trio walks back into the church, and this time, it\\u2019s Joon-hyuk who says that he won\\u2019t be giving up Woo-jin to Human B. \\u201cHe has Woo-jin\\u2019s memories, so he\\u2019s Woo-jin, no matter what anyone says,\\u201d Joon-hyuk asserts. Dong-soo comes forward and pouts that his teacher is still so baby-faced. Woo-jin asks him if he studied hard, and Dong-soo says that he didn\\u2019t, but adds that he lives a \\u201ccrime-free\\u201d life now using computers. Pfft.  Seeing how friendly Joon-hyuk is with Dong-soo, Woo-jin asks how they know each other, and Joon-hyuk explains that he\\u2019d saved Dong-soo\\u2019s life years ago. In a flashback, we see that teenaged Dong-soo was about to enter Professor Han\\u2019s blood donation van when he had been dragged away by Bum-gyun. When Dong-soo wasn\\u2019t convinced by Bum-gyun\\u2019s talk of an \\u201calien conspiracy,\\u201d Bum-gyun paid him cash money to avoid the van (and thus, avoid a bug in his brain). In the present, Dong-soo admits that he later found out that the Bum-gyun who saved him then is the Joon-hyuk they know now, complaining that Joon-hyuk has used that favor to torment him for years, ha. He turns to Joon-hyuk to ask if he can leave now that Joon-hyuk has found his brother, but Joon-hyuk just deadpans that Dong-soo can go after he performs seven more favors for him. (Dong-soo: \\u201cWhy does that number never decrease?!\\u201d)  Chief Hong asks Woo-jin what happened that night twenty years ago, and Joon-hyuk explains that Woo-jin had lied about the research to save their lives. Chief Hong realizes that they were right about their assumptions: Woo-jin had been used to run the supercomputer with the help of Byul\\u2019s memory device. Joon-hyuk tells them that they now have to choose between making the perfect escape, or taking Human B down for good. For his part, Woo-jin refuses to run away, explaining that the world turned out this way because he tried to run away twenty years ago. Joon-hyuk agrees, which whittles down their options to one: take Human B down. Inside Human B, Deputy Chief Lee becomes visibly nervous when Minister Park calls in the SWAT team to deal with the \\u201cterrorists\\u201d on Smart Earth. Deputy Chief Lee worries that the SWAT team will cause unrest among the citizens, but Minister Park is past the point of caring.  Even as Minister Park becomes aware of Lee\\u2019s doubts, Secretary Shin comes in and informs them that they don\\u2019t have enough doctors to attend to the many citizens suffering from pain because of their emerging memories. Minister Park directs her to call in doctors from Ordinary Earth and to tell the citizens that their pain is the work of the terrorists. We then see the cube that used to be in Byul\\u2019s star attached to the wall. On the other side of the wall is the empty room where Woo-jin had been comatose all this time.  As the number of aggrieved citizens with headaches grows outside Human B, Mayor Yoon lies with his eyes open in his hospital room. Dong-soo intercepts a radio message about the arriving SWAT team, and Detective Oh worries that if Jung-yeon and Woo-jin will be apprehended, the rest of them will be shot on sight. Joon-hyuk says that they need evidence that will prove that Minister Park has control of both Human B and Smart Earth. Chief Hong says that it would be impossible to get to any such evidence, but Jung-yeon points out that there is one person who could help them: Mayor Yoon.  She explains that only Bluebird or Human B could have erased Mayor Yoon\\u2019s memories, and since she didn\\u2019t do it, then Human B must have because he learned something they didn\\u2019t want him to know. The group is energized at this realization, but Jung-yeon knows that it won\\u2019t be easy with Mayor Yoon in a guarded medical center. They can see no way to get in, until Dong-soo\\u2019s radio crackles with the order for Ordinary Earth doctors to be allowed into Smart Earth. With that revelation, Joon-hyuk says that there is only one person who can get in there without getting caught. Cut to: Min-young heading through Smart Earth security after identifying herself as a doctor. She gets into the medical center with ease and walks straight up to a heavily guarded corridor, where she ducks out of sight to survey the area.  An anonymous caller tips Minister Park off about the fugitives hiding at the church, and Deputy Chief Lee alerts the SWAT team. Even as Minister Park begins to look smug, Deputy Chief Lee asks hesitantly if the other four must be shot on sight. Minister Park asks what else should be done with them, and Deputy Chief Lee says that killing them would be going too far. With narrowed eyes, Minister Park reminds Lee that he was the one who killed Woo-jin all those years ago. Deputy Chief Lee defends that it was only an accident, though Minister Park calls even that into question before asking his old pupil to be patient just a little longer.  The SWAT team surrounds the church and searches every corner until someone shouts that they\\u2019ve found something. As they drag Woo-jin out, we see Joon-hyuk explain his plan in flashback: He says that there is one person who can safely get into the hospital, but Dong-soo asks what the point would be in getting to Mayor Yoon if the person  needed to run the supercomputer (Woo-jin) remains here. Woo-jin volunteers to go, so Detective Oh makes the call that tips off Minister Park. They estimate that it will take about forty-five minutes from the moment of apprehension to Woo-jin being reconnected to Human B, which means they only have forty-five minutes to reach the mayor and hack into Human B.  In the present, Minister Park is notified that Woo-jin has been caught and orders him to be brought to the 99th floor. The moment they push Woo-jin into his old room, the cube in the wall lights up, and the whole building powers up again. In the control room, the technicians are taken aback when the supercomputer boots up again, seemingly by itself. Minister Park smiles slyly at Woo-jin as he asks why he was left behind: \\u201cDid they say that you weren\\u2019t Woo-jin?\\u201d He advises Woo-jin to just accept that he\\u2019s Circle 8-III and tell him where Jung-yeon is. Woo-jin denies knowing her whereabouts, but Minister Park simply smiles and calls someone to check Woo-jin\\u2019s memories as soon as the computer is back online.  Woo-jin grits his teeth and quietly prays for his team to hurry. In the health center, Min-young checks the time and walks confidently into the guarded corridor. Seeing her ID, the guards let her in to check on the mayor, and Min-young takes the opportunity to inject a sedative into Mayor Yoon\\u2019s veins. Then, she calls out for help, claiming that Mayor Yoon needs to be taken in for a CT scan immediately. The guards put him on a gurney and get into an elevator with her. As the elevator stops on the third floor, Chief Hong, Detective Oh, and Dong-soo enter in patient garbs and wait until the elevator descends to attack the guards inside.  After the guards are dispensed with, Chief Hong grins triumphantly at Min-young and turns around, leaving him unaware when a guard pops back up behind him. Luckily, Min-young still has her handy pink taser, and she tazes the guard down, leaving all the men shocked. The news of Mayor Yoon\\u2019s kidnapping reaches Minister Park, and he immediately realizes that something is off. Thinking about it for a moment, he turns to Woo-jin and asks him if he got caught on purpose. Only now does he figure out that they needed Woo-jin to connect to the supercomputer so that they could look through the mayor\\u2019s memories to find evidence against him.  Deputy Chief Lee suggests disconnecting Woo-jin from the supercomputer, but Minister Park is confident that they can replay Woo-jin\\u2019s memories faster than Bluebird can hack into Mayor Yoon\\u2019s chip. As they leave the room, Woo-jin thinks back to their plans in the church. We flash back to see that Dong-soo had pointed out that as soon as Minister Park played back Woo-jin\\u2019s memories, their whole plan would be laid bare. Everyone realizes that this is true, but Joon-hyuk says that this is the only plan they have for now, adding that they\\u2019d have to take the chance that Minister Park wouldn\\u2019t play back Woo-jin\\u2019s memories.  In the present, Woo-jin grimaces and urges his brother to hurry as Minister Park and the deputy chief reach the control room and send all the technicians out. The minister orders the memory footage played and watches as Joon-hyuk tells his team where they will meet with Mayor Yoon while he and Jung-yeon ready the place to hack into the mayor\\u2019s memories. Minister Park has the supercomputer disconnected from Woo-jin, and the entire building plunges into darkness once again. He orders Deputy Chief Lee to go and apprehend Jung-yeon, and while Lee agrees, he looks less than enthusiastic. On his way to the location, the deputy chief tells Secretary Shin that they need to finish this without anyone ending up dead. But when they reach the warehouse Joon-hyuk mentioned in the memory file, they find it empty. And back at Human B, the building lights up again as the supercomputer comes alive.  Minister Park sends his minion to see what\\u2019s going on while Woo-jin smiles in relief before leveling a glare at Park. And we see why he was smiling as we cut to the control room, where the head technician sits tied on the floor as Jung-yeon and Joon-hyuk work one of the consoles. Up on the 99th floor, Woo-jin asks Minister Park, \\u201cDid you say you can see everything in our memory footage?\\u201d But Woo-jin already knows the answer as he notes triumphantly, \\u201cEven if you can see into my memory, you can\\u2019t experience it.\\u201d We flash back to the church once again, when everyone had realized that their plan would be exposed the moment Minister Park replays Woo-jin\\u2019s memories. Just then, we hear a series of knocks.  Joon-hyuk looks over at Woo-jin, who raps out a tattoo against the wood of the benches. They both think back to their childhood games of deciphering Morse code messages from each other, and Joon-hyuk understands what Woo-jin\\u2019s saying in code: \\u201cLet\\u2019s use this method. Trick me.\\u201d Joon-hyuk takes Jung-yeon outside and tells her the real plan. Fast forwarding to five hours from the present, we see Min-young entering Smart Earth with a suitcase, which is smoothly swiped by Dong-soo as he walks past her. Joon-hyuk and Jung-yeon open the suitcase to reveal SWAT team gear.  So, when the real SWAT team arrives at the church to find the fugitives, we see Woo-jin hiding in a smaller room along with Jung-yeon and Joon-hyuk, who were dressed as members of the SWAT team. Upon hearing the real SWAT team grow closer, both Joon-hyuk and Jung-yeon had pulled down their masks and acted as though they\\u2014ordinary members of the team\\u2014had just found Woo-jin. Mingling with the other SWAT team members, the two get are able to get inside Human B and quietly separate from the rest of the team as soon as chance permits. Getting into the stairwell, they take off their masks and arm their guns.  Thirty minutes before the present, Detective Oh carries the mayor down to the health center\\u2019s basement as Dong-soo uses his radio to sound the alarm that Mayor Yoon has been kidnapped. Then, ten minutes before the present, Minister Park finishes watching the footage and orders the supercomputer disconnected from Woo-jin. They did this by powering down the building, which made it easy for Jung-yeon and Joon-hyuk to enter the control room as soon as the minister left. Now, even as Minister Park realizes that Jung-yeon must be in the control room and yells for security to be sent there, his minion hands him his phone. The footage playing on it is from Mayor Yoon\\u2019s last moments. (Oh. Snap.)  In the video, Minister Park asks the mayor what would be the easiest way to silence Joon-hyuk and answers his own question: \\u201cBlock his memories.\\u201d As he reveals himself as the CEO of Human B whose chip is inside the mayor\\u2019s head, the footage is sent to every phone and television on Smart Earth. Everyone from Secretary Shin to the normal citizens of Smart Earth are taken aback by Minister Park\\u2019s duplicity. Everywhere in Smart Earth, Stable Care Chips turn livid red in the necks of all the people who watch the minister gloat about his power on screen, and that\\u2019s even before Minister Park makes the call that would erase all Mayor Yoon\\u2019s memories. Woo-jin looks at Minister Park in his room and scoffs, \\u201cWhat will we do now? Everyone knows.\\u201d The minister throws away the phone in rage.  Ho-soo watches the footage with his superior standing beside him. He turns to the man, who now believes his claims, and tells him that Minister Park must be arrested. Borrowing his superior\\u2019s phone, Ho-soo calls Joon-hyuk, who tells him that he needs a favor. Up on the 99th Floor of Human B, Minister Park is having a panic attack as more and more people in power call his phone. Woo-jin just smiles even as Minister Park loses it and calls for his private helicopter. Wherever he\\u2019s going, he plans to take Woo-jin with him.  Minister Park goes out to where the memory device is safely ensconced inside a glass box and takes the cube out. As Joon-hyuk and Jung-yeon reach the 99th floor, they hear Woo-jin being dragged into the corridor and follow the minister and Woo-jin up the staircase to the helipad on the roof. As Joon-hyuk and Jung-yeon make it onto the helipad with their guns aimed straight for Minister Park, their enemy just laughs at their effort as he wonders why they\\u2019re trying so hard to save a clone. When Joon-hyuk yells that this is Woo-jin, Minister Park says, \\u201cWake up, Joon-hyuk. Your brother, Woo-jin, died in an accident fifteen years ago. He stopped breathing. I buried him with my own hands.\\u201d When Joon-hyuk makes as if to shoot him, Minister Park just doubles down as he says that that Woo-jin is dead. \\u201cIf this is Kim Woo-jin,\\u201d he asks, pointing at the clone, \\u201cthen what does that make your dead brother?\\u201d  As Joon-hyuk struggles to come up with something to say, Jung-yeon answers: \\u201cFate. Woo-jin became our fate. Joon-hyuk dedicated his life to finding Woo-jin when he didn\\u2019t even have his own memories. I dedicated my life to finding Woo-jin because of my memories with him. And now, we\\u2019re at the end of our journey. This time, we\\u2019ll protect him the same way he protected us twenty years ago!\\u201d Looking at his brother, Joon-hyuk asks, \\u201cDidn\\u2019t I tell you I\\u2019d never go anywhere without you ever again? This time, I\\u2019ll keep my promise.\\u201d (My heart!) Taking out his own gun, Minister Park points it at Woo-jin\\u2019s head as he orders Jung-yeon and Joon-hyuk to leave if they don\\u2019t want to see him killed. It doesn\\u2019t matter to Minister Park either way\\u2014he can always make another Woo-jin.  Deputy Chief Lee and Secretary Shin walk back into Human B just as Smart Earth\\u2019s security personnel arrive to arrest Minister Park. The deputy chief orders his men to block them, and as the two small armies collide, he and Secretary Shin continue on their way. Back on the helipad, we see Minister Park tell Joon-hyuk (in an eerie singsong voice): \\u201cDon\\u2019t make him [Woo-jin] die again.\\u201d Something inside Woo-jin snaps at this, and he throws his body into Minister Park\\u2019s in an attempt to disarm him.  During the scuffle, Jung-yeon shoots Minister Park\\u2019s minion in the arm and kicks his gun away. Joon-hyuk looks for a clear shot as Minister Park and Woo-jin wrestle for control of the gun, and just when Minister Park is able to throw Woo-jin off and level his gun at him, Joon-hyuk shoots him in the leg. The minister\\u2019s precious memory cube slips out of his grasp and falls on the ground. Woo-jin scrambles to grab it before returning to the safety of Joon-hyuk and Jung-yeon. From the ground, Minister Park begs for the cube, promising/threatening that everyone can go home if he gets it. Woo-jin clasps the cube tight and says that it never belonged to Minister Park to begin with. Just when it looks like our heroes will be able to walk away from all this, Deputy Chief Lee and his people arrive with guns in hand to surround them.  In the ensuing standoff, Deputy Chief Lee\\u2019s people drag Minister Park over to their side. Joon-hyuk and Jung-yeon are vastly outnumbered as Park orders Deputy Chief Lee to kill all three of them. As the two sides wait for the first shot to go off, Minister Park realizes that the deputy chief is hesitating. \\u201cYou killed Woo-jin once before, why can\\u2019t you do it a second time?\\u201d Minister Park asks Lee. \\u201cShoot! Shoot!\\u201d Hearing this, Joon-hyuk aims his gun at the deputy chief, but Lee still hesitates. Recognizing his sunbae in Lee, Woo-jin takes a slow step forward. Speaking to him as his sunbae, Woo-jin asks, \\u201cHow did you end up like this?\\u201d A conflicted look passes over Deputy Chief Lee\\u2019s face as he says that he only wanted to survive, so he did as he was told. Then, loosening his collar, he looks over at Minister Park and asks, \\u201cProfessor, is this the brave new world you always spoke about?\\u201d  This seems to get to Minister Park, as he shrugs off his minions\\u2019 support and takes a step towards Woo-jin. \\u201cWhat did I do wrong?\\u201d he asks defensively. \\u201cJustice and responsibility? Why are they important? They said they wanted to be happy. They said all they wanted was happiness. That\\u2019s what I gave them. I gave them what they were asking for. I\\u2026 simply did what I thought was right.\\u201d Woo-jin steps close to Minister Park and says, \\u201cThen I, too, will do what I think is right.\\u201d He pulls his arm back and throws the memory cube off the top of the building with all his might. Minister Park moves to catch it, and as it flies over the edge of the roof, the minister follows the cube blindly into the empty air below.  Everyone goes still in the immediate aftermath, and Deputy Chief Lee cracks a very small smile. More than a hundred floors below, the minister\\u2019s broken body lies on the pavement (an eerie mirror to Woo-jin\\u2019s demise) as he spends his final moments watching the memory cube roll into the sewer \\u2014 hopefully never to be seen again. Up on the roof, Deputy Chief Lee whispers, \\u201cSo, this is how it ends.\\u201d Before anyone can sigh with relief, he snaps up his gun, and everyone follows suit. They freeze again in a tense standoff, until, suddenly, Deputy Chief Lee presses the barrel of his gun into his own temple.  Secretary Shin catches his arm and shakes her head. After a long beat, the deputy chief gives in and drops his gun. Both sides finally breathe easy as their standoff come to an end. Some time later, Ho-soo holds a press conference that is aired live across both Smart and Ordinary Earth. He reveals that Minister Park had secretly been running Human B, and that he\\u2019d been blocking the memories of Smart Earth Citizens under the name of the Stable Care Chip System. He tells them about the murder that first opened Smart Earth to Joon-hyuk\\u2019s investigation. Ho-soo explains that the minister blocked Mayor Yoon\\u2019s memories while trying to cover up his tracks and that he blamed Bluebird, who had been working to unblock the citizens\\u2019 memories. In response to what will happen now that the Care Chip system has been deactivated, Ho-soo says:  \\u201cTo the citizens who have had your memories blocked, your memories will return to you. You will feel very confused, possibly even tormented. There are certainly those who will have been made happy through the memory block. However, the result of blocking painful memories have made some forget the wrongs they have committed. And someone else will have forgotten someone who must not be forgotten.\\u201d As he says that, Ho-soo flashes back to happier times with his girlfriend as he thinks to himself, \\u201cThere was a woman who certainly existed, whom I certainly loved.\\u201d Then, he resumes his speech: \\u201cPlease accept the memories that come to you. If you have forgotten something you ought not have forgotten, remember it. And if you have forgotten a wrong you committed, take responsibility for it. And if you have forgotten sadness\\u2026 if you have forgotten sadness\\u2026. I wish for you to feel sadness. Because that is what it means to be human. Finally, no matter what, please remember what happened to us in the year 2037. As of today, Human B does not exist.\\u201d As the press conference airs, a conference room full of politicians wonder what Human B has done and how they can recover from it. Into that chaos walks in Mayor Yoon, who quiets the room and tells them that he\\u2019ll take the responsibility for bringing peace and stability to the city.  Joon-hyuk packs his bag of belongings to leave Ho-soo\\u2019s house. Ho-soo tries to make him stay by asking him to lead the new police force of Smart Earth. \\u201cI\\u2019m asking you to participate in a society that takes responsibility,\\u201d he tells Joon-hyuk. With characteristic devilry, Joon-hyuk turns Ho-soo\\u2019s head to check if he still has a chip in his head. \\u201cHow else do you say such a cheesy thing with a straight face?\\u201d he asks his erstwhile partner. Ha, and aww. After making Ho-soo laugh, Joon-hyuk declares his intent to leave the police force and become a pastry chef. Ho-soo tells him not to do it: \\u201cTo be honest, I don\\u2019t hate bread. I just couldn\\u2019t eat the bread you made.\\u201d He predicts that Joon-hyuk\\u2019s bakery will go out of business. \\u201cIs that your advice?\\u201d asks Joon-hyuk. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a warning,\\u201d says Ho-soo. Then, the two burst into laughter.  Outside, Joon-hyuk walks towards Woo-jin and Jung-yeon. The camera moves with Joon-hyuk as he turns and puts an arm around his brother. Then, smiling, the three go down the path. Then, the moment turns into a sketch, and we see Chief Hong putting the finishing touches to the final scene of his webcomic. Detective Oh appears beside him, and Chief Hong remarks that all three of his old cases have now been resolved, so now, he needs something new. Joon-hyuk visits Min-young at her hospital, and we learn that he comes almost every day with new burn injuries from his attempts to bake cakes. As Min-young patches up his hand, we see a flashback to twenty years ago, when a younger Min-young used to take care of a comatose Bum-gyun.  Joon-hyuk smiles at her now, and after she\\u2019s done, he hands her a cake box. \\u201cI burnt my hand making that, so enjoy it,\\u201d he tells her. Min-young looks down at the box, a wide smile spreading over her face. Jung-yeon stands over Professor Han, who is now hospitalized. She tells the sleeping old man that she\\u2019ll visit again, calling him \\u201cDad\\u201d just like she used to. She comes out of the hospital depressed, but wipes away her tears when she sees Woo-jin waiting for her. As they walk together, she points out that he\\u2019d drawn a heart between \\u201cWoo-jin\\u201d and \\u201cByul\\u201d inside the star he\\u2019d given her. \\u201cWas that when you started liking me?\\u201d she asks with a grin. Woo-jin dismisses it by saying that all kids like anyone who\\u2019s nice to them. Jung-yeon refuses to give up on teasing him about liking her for so long, and Woo-jin ends up laughing.  Joon-hyuk comes out from his cake delivery to Min-young and smiles when he sees the two together. He walks at a distance to give the two some space, and Jung-yeon admits that she was happy when Woo-jin gave her that star. Woo-jin smiles at this, and the two walk along in sweet awkwardness, until Woo-jin looks up and notices a news flash on a jumbotron. There was apparently a dark fog and a blackout in Gimpo the night before. The newscaster says that witnesses saw a bright gleam of light, which they note as being similar to the incident that happened in the brothers\\u2019 neighborhood thirty years ago.  They both get thoughtful expressions on their faces, and Woo-jin asks if Jung-yeon remembers what happened back then. Looking confused, Jung-yeon says that while she can\\u2019t remember the moment specifically, she remembers how she felt. Joon-hyuk comes up from behind them and tries to surprise Jung-yeon, but neither of the two react. He asks why they\\u2019re so serious, when the newscaster says that the fog and light incident is similar to something that happened thirty years ago. And even before that, in 1986, there was one more instance when a large ball of light fell from the sky. As the newscaster wonders what that light could be, the brothers look at Jung-yeon. The camera zooms close to her face, and suddenly, Jung-yeon\\u2019s face loses all expression as her irises shine with the cosmic spirals of faraway galaxies.The tables have turned once again, and I\\u2019m loving it! Instead of being outmaneuvered by Human B\\u2019s nefarious villains, Woo-jin takes charge of his own destiny and begins his plot to trap them instead. Instead of being just book smart, we see that Woo-jin is resourceful and clever on his feet as well, and that he\\u2019s always ready to sacrifice himself for those he loves. Then again, I guess if my friends and family were on the line, I\\u2019d be willing to make some sacrifices too.  EPISODE 11 RECAP  Opening up the USB file containing his father\\u2019s research, Woo-jin thinks he\\u2019s found the way to save Bum-gyun\\u2019s life at last. And when a video of his father describing his research pops up, Woo-jin\\u2019s face breaks out in a relieved grin\\u2026 until he realizes that this video isn\\u2019t an explanation of the research at all. In the video, his father explains that he destroyed all his research, effectively ending the Beta Project: \\u201cI decided that this technology isn\\u2019t something that humans should have.\\u201d In a series of flashbacks, we see that Kim Kyu-chul had been confronted by a dilemma when he realized that Byul\\u2019s memory technology had the potential to ruin lives. Despite the fact that the technology could be used to help people with PTSD, Kim Kyu-chul had argued furiously against it when a younger version of Professor Han tried to persuade him to continue with the research, since Han believed that the removal of unpleasant memories would allow them, as imperfect as they were, to create a brave new world without crime or war.  But to that line of argument, Kim Kyu-chul had said, \\u201cBut imperfect human beings will be in control of that technology. Someone will definitely try to take control of it! If that happens, people will be able to manipulate the memories of others, and will even be able to control them!\\u201d Byul, who was watching their argument, went up to Kyu-chul after Professor Han was gone and asked for her memory to be erased. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t consider humanity\\u2019s greed,\\u201d she\\u2019d said. \\u201cIt would be better to get rid of this technology than to allow it to be used for dark purposes.\\u201d  After the deed was done, Professor Han had demanded to know where Byul was, desperate to obtain that technology. Even after Kyu-chul told him that Byul\\u2019s memories were gone, Han refused to believe it, and had attempted to persuade Kyu-chul by pointing toward a group of threatening men down the hallway, headed by a younger Detective Choi. \\u201cIf things go wrong, you and I could both end up dying,\\u201d Professor Han added. However, in the video that Woo-jin watches, his father says the data was destroyed because he made an ethical decision to stop the research. Woo-jin reels back in shock as he finally registers that there\\u2019s no research data for him to use, and thus, there\\u2019s no way for him to save Bum-gyun. It puts Woo-jin in a daze as he realizes that the information he needs to save his brother will only be obtained if he agrees to do as Professor Han threatened him to. But he snaps out of it quickly when Min-young calls in a frantic voice to tell him that Bum-gyun\\u2019s in trouble, and that they\\u2019re on the way to the hospital.  Woo-jin arrives to the hospital in time to see the doctors use a defibrillator on his flatlined brother, who\\u2019s gone into cardiac arrest. The doctors try shock after shock, until finally, Bum-gyun\\u2019s pulse returns. Woo-jin all but collapses in relief, finally able to breathe again. When Min-young\\u2019s father explains Bum-gyun\\u2019s state to the group (consisting of Chief Hong, Min-young, Woo-jin, and Jung-yeon), he lets them know that Bum-gyun will only worsen and has a high chance of dying if the blue bug inside his brain isn\\u2019t removed. And because the bug has burrowed into the brain so deep, Min-young\\u2019s father says that the only people with the proper expertise to remove it would be its creators, or the people who inserted it in the first place.  Hearing this, Jung-yeon tries to secretly text her father, saying that she\\u2019ll agree to his terms and try her best to recover her memory as Byul if he makes sure that Bum-gyun receives his life-saving surgery. However, Woo-jin catches her, and remembering that his father said that Byul made the choice to erase her memories, he stops her from sending Professor Han the text. He also reassures her by showing her the crucifix USB, lying that it\\u2019s his father\\u2019s research data, which he plans on using to bargain with Professor Han. It\\u2019s enough to fool Jung-yeon, even as Woo-jin thinks of his father saying that the research no longer exists.  But being the clever kid he is, Woo-jin begins a plan to fool Professor Han in order to get him to perform Bum-gyun\\u2019s surgery. At 3:00 p.m. on June 26th, he goes to a karaoke room and puts his mic up to the speaker, enduring the agony of listening to the screeching sound caused by the sound waves\\u2019 interference. Moments later, we see him asking Young Dong-soo for a request (though we don\\u2019t hear what it is), and Woo-jin eventually acquiesces to a deal that the rascal makes to get out of four tutoring sessions. Meanwhile, Professor Park tells Sunbae Lee that they must both be extremely cautious and secretive from now on. He opens up an email on his computer from Woo-jin that had the beginning clip of Kyu-chul\\u2019s introductory message where he said: \\u201cThis is the last log of the Beta Project\\u2026\\u201d  But the video cuts off before getting to the part where Kyu-chul talked about destroying the data, leading Professor Park to believe that there\\u2019s more. Professor Park immediately calls Woo-jin to ask where the rest of the video is, and Woo-jin, who still thinks Professor Park is on his side, tells him to relay the message to Professor Han that he wants to exchange his father\\u2019s data for Bum-gyun\\u2019s surgery. But it turns out that Woo-jin is back at his old house setting up his father\\u2019s office for the confrontation he knows is coming, which includes setting up his memory file from the noraebang to play. He finds the hidden camera that Professor Park installed in front of his father\\u2019s computer, but he thinks that it\\u2019s Professor Han\\u2019s dirty work and leaves it there, since it\\u2019ll only help his plan.  Pretending to be the good guy, Professor Park tells Woo-jin over the phone that \\u201cProfessor Han\\u201d will probably want some sort of evidence or collateral for Bum-gyun\\u2019s surgery, and Woo-jin says that he\\u2019ll be a hostage. Professor Park agrees that this would probably work and tells Woo-jin that this will all be over once he hands over the data. Sunbae Lee asks Professor Park if it really will be over once they get the data, but Professor Park replies that it\\u2019ll only be the beginning, since he plans on both using Woo-jin and Jung-yeon to restart the Beta Project.  After calling in some help to create an effective trap, Professor Park calls Woo-jin on his burner phone. Acting as though he\\u2019s being threatened by Professor Han and Human B, he tells Woo-jin that the other side has agreed to his request and that they want him to come to a meeting to discuss terms and hand over the data. Woo-jin knows that he\\u2019ll be walking into a trap, so he begins saying his last goodbyes to everyone. They\\u2019re worried that he\\u2019s going into a dangerous situation alone; Chief Hong suggests that he help out, but Woo-jin says that he and Min-young should concentrate on getting Bum-gyun to a safe location as soon as his surgery is finished.  To deflect suspicion, Woo-jin puts an optimistic spin on everything, saying that it\\u2019ll be a simple handoff of the data. Plus, he adds that Professor Park will be there, and once the data changes hands, he\\u2019ll be free to go. However, Woo-jin does have some doubts, and it shows when he watches Bum-gyun sleep in his hospital room. Bum-gyun wakes up with a smile, and after joking a bit back and forth with him, Woo-jin suddenly leans in to tell Bum-gyun something that we don\\u2019t get to hear. When we see Woo-jin next, he\\u2019s handing Jung-yeon a pouch of things for his grandma, including next month\\u2019s hospice fee. He asks Jung-yeon to visit and take care of his grandma since he\\u2019s been too busy to do so recently.  It\\u2019s almost like he knows he may not survive the encounter and is preparing for that eventuality, because when Jung-yeon asks to go with him again, he just asks her to take care of everything while he\\u2019s gone. He stands up to leave, and she watches his retreating back until he turns back and returns to her. Without preamble, Woo-jin pulls her into a gentle hug, which she reciprocates. He tells her that he\\u2019ll be back soon, and she replies that she\\u2019ll be waiting. Woo-jin arrives on scene at an abandoned building, where a group of gangsters (including Detective Choi) stand around with Professor Park looking helpless among them. Woo-jin takes out a jar full of clear liquid and produces the cross USB, which Professor Park recognizes from his days spent researching at Kyu-chul\\u2019s house.  Woo-jin says that he\\u2019ll hand it over once he knows that his brother\\u2019s surgery has finished successfully. However, Detective Choi tries to pry it from him beforehand, resulting in a brief struggle. Prepared, Woo-jin drops the cross into the jar of what must be some sort of acid, since the USB immediately begins disintegrating. Detective Choi grabs Woo-jin by the throat and begins to choke him, and Professor Park, seeing his dreams fizzling in a jar, puts a stop to it. When Woo-jin sees Detective Choi taking orders from Professor Park, he finally realizes who was behind this setup in the first place.  Although he\\u2019s shocked that he\\u2019s been betrayed, Woo-jin quickly adapts to the situation and tells Professor Park that he\\u2019s their only hope of getting his father\\u2019s research data now that the USB has been destroyed. He adds that they can find out what they want to know by playing back his memories on his father\\u2019s computer \\u2014 however, if they harm him or if he refuses, it\\u2019s all over. With that, Professor Park has no choice but to agree to Woo-jin\\u2019s request to save his brother. He makes the call. The surgery finishes successfully, and the writhing electronic bug is taken out of Bum-gyun\\u2019s brain. Chief Hong calls Woo-jin immediately afterward, and tells him to come home safely. Now that his end of the deal has been carried out, Professor Park gets his goons to carry Woo-jin back to Kyu-chul\\u2019s old house in order to activate the system.  Once they\\u2019re in Kyu-chul\\u2019s old office, Professor Park and his goons impatiently lean into the computer while Woo-jin bides his time and surreptitiously maxes the volume out on the speaker he set up earlier. Woo-jin then activates his own memory of the horrendous noise he endured at the karaoke place, which plays loud enough to burst eardrums in the office. Woo-jin\\u2019s the only one unaffected, since he brought a pair of earplugs. So while everyone else is incapacitated by the screeching noise, he quickly snatches the star and makes his escape. We learn that he\\u2019d asked Dong-soo to cut the power to the house once he heard the sound, and to get out of dodge afterward. With Dong-soo at the helm outside, the lights go out as soon as the screeching sound is heard, which gives Woo-jin a valuable chance to escape.  Jung-yeon waits at an empty bus stop while on her way to see Woo-jin\\u2019s grandma when she receives a video message from none other than Woo-jin himself. In it, he reveals that he found out that it was Byul\\u2019s wish to have her memories erased because of humanity\\u2019s greed and the technology\\u2019s potential for destruction. He tells her that because she only has the memories of Han Jung-yeon, she\\u2019s only Han Jung-yeon to him, and he tells her to live as Han Jung-yeon instead of trying too hard to reclaim her memories as Byul. \\u201cTo me, you\\u2019re no longer Byul, but Han Jung-yeon,\\u201d he adds. \\u201cI will return to Han Jung-yeon. So run away as soon as you see this. Anywhere is fine. But if, by some chance, something happens to me, you still have to run away. Protect yourself until the very end.\\u201d  Having given chase after the stunt Woo-jin pulled, Detective Choi pursues Woo-jin into a forest, where he loses him. Woo-jin watches from his nearby hiding spot as Detective Choi taunts that this is all very similar to the way his father died Detective Choi just calls for Woo-jin, saying that this is very similar to the way his father died. And in flashback, we see that Kim Kyu-chul had been shot and killed by none other than Detective Choi. Shocked and enraged by this revelation, Woo-jin takes a rock and smashes it over Detective Choi\\u2019s head from behind, but the ex-cop makes a quick recovery and ends up pointing a gun to Woo-jin\\u2019s head. He\\u2019s clearly mentally unstable as he yells \\u201cDie! Die! Die!\\u201d just as he prepares to shoot Woo-jin. But Professor Park arrives with reinforcements and manages to grab the gun, since he\\u2019d specifically said that Woo-jin had to remain alive. The other Human B gangsters force Woo-jin onto his knees, and Professor Park finally asks him whether the data even exists.  Woo-jin replies that it doesn\\u2019t, but Professor Park says that\\u2019s not a big loss, because they can probably recover it as long as they can track down Byul. Shouting for them not to touch Jung-yeon, Woo-jin protests vigorously against the restraining hands. Professor Park kneels down to explain to him that they\\u2019re on the verge of a scientific breakthrough, but Woo-jin just tells him that he\\u2019s trash. Woo-jin knows that Professor Park\\u2019s actual motive isn\\u2019t something as lofty as scientific progress, but greed for the technology contained in the star Woo-jin holds. Professor Park doesn\\u2019t disagree \\u2014 in fact, he asks if being greedy is so wrong.  Thinking fast, Woo-jin throws a handful of dirt into one of his captor\\u2019s eyes and makes another break for it. He\\u2019s almost successful in his mission to lose his pursuers in the forest, but in his blind rush, he ends up on a road. Everything seems to happen instantly \\u2014 no sooner do Woo-jin\\u2019s feet hit the asphalt do we hear and see the car speeding toward him. A shocked sort of realization hits Woo-jin just moments before the car makes a sickening impact, sending Woo-jin flying into the air before he falls to the ground in a broken heap. (Noooo!!!)  The driver of the car is none other than Sunbae Lee, whose shocked face tells us that this was all a terrible accident. As blood begins to pool and spread from Woo-jin\\u2019s head, his eyes focus on the alien cube that was hidden inside the star, which was shattered in the impact. As Professor Park and his cronies look on helplessly, Woo-jin tries desperately to reach for the cube, but his body won\\u2019t do what he wants it to. Woo-jin manages to say Jung-yeon\\u2019s name, and we cut to her watching the rest of his video at the bus stop. As we see Woo-jin try and fail to reach the cube, we cut back to him (in video form) telling Jung-yeon to open her bag. Inside, she cries to find the pendant we\\u2019ve never seen her without in 2037 as Woo-jin\\u2019s narration continues: \\u201cWait for me. Wherever you are\\u2026 I\\u2019ll find you.\\u201d  Back on the road, Woo-jin doesn\\u2019t give up his struggle even as bright, happy memories of Bum-gyun play through his mind. He reaches for the cube as his strength fades, and ever so slowly, we see the spark fade from his eyes as his body goes limp. The cube lights up once, then goes dark. Woo-jin wakes with a start in a hospital bed with an IV line attached. Remembering the accident, he searches his body for injuries, only to find none. But when he tries to leave the room, he realizes that the door is locked, and no amount of yelling gets it to open.  With tears running down his face, Woo-jin remembers his promise to return to Jung-yeon and the moment when he\\u2019d confided something to Bum-gyun in the hospital room. He throws everything he can at the door, but the sudden sound of an alarm seems to unlock the door. Taking the opportunity, Woo-jin escapes at a dead run from the hospital room and bolts into the exit stairwell as he all but flies down the steps\\u2026 only to suddenly stop dead. Peering around the bend, Woo-jin sees\\u2026  \\u2026Joon-hyuk and Jung-yeon? (What?!) We finally know what Jung-yeon and Joon-hyuk saw that shocked them so much in the past episode, as both of them look up to see Woo-jin looking just like he did when they last saw him. While Joon-hyuk calls out to his brother disbelievingly, a confused Woo-jin backs away from the strange man uneasily. But Woo-jin does recognize Jung-yeon, though she\\u2019s too stunned to answer any of his questions. Joon-hyuk desperately grabs onto Woo-jin\\u2019s arm as he asks if he\\u2019s really Woo-jin. \\u201cI\\u2019m\\u2026 Bum-gyun. Kim Bum-gyun,\\u201d Joon-hyuk says through his tears. Woo-jin: \\u201cHyung?\\u201d Seeing Woo-jin\\u2019s empty hospital bedroom, Minister Park orders Deputy Chief Lee to find \\u201cCircle 8.\\u201d Part 2: Brave New World  We rewind back to two and a half years after Woo-jin\\u2019s car accident, and Jung-yeon has disappeared without a trace. Professor Park has been keeping Woo-jin alive on an artificial ventilator with the star cube at his bedside, but he\\u2019s told that Woo-jin\\u2019s organs are deteriorating past the point of saving. So, Minister Park convinces a foreign researcher to perform human clinical trials on cloning by enticing the man with a future of unrestricted funding, resources, and fame. In 2022, their clinical trials succeed, and because Professor Park no longer has a need for the original Woo-jin, he tells the doctors to put him out of his misery. Back in 2037, a tearful Joon-hyuk can\\u2019t understand how Woo-jin looks the same, even though twenty years have passed. Woo-jin can\\u2019t believe that it\\u2019s been so long, because to him, it seems like only yesterday that his entire encounter with Professor Park and Detective Choi happened. \\u201cAre you really my hyung?\\u201d Woo-jin asks with wide eyes as he takes Joon-hyuk in.  However, since they\\u2019re still being chased inside the Human B building, they make their escape first. When they get to a place to rest, Woo-jin reveals what he learned on his last day: that it was Professor Park who was the ultimate mastermind, and not Professor Han. While Woo-jin wonders how he can still look the same even though twenty years have passed, Joon-hyuk thinks back to what both the insane Professor Han and what Professor Park told him at their standoff\\u2014that Woo-jin was alive. In addition, his own memory (not the ones he received from Woo-jin) start to resurface, but they\\u2019re still on the run. With Joon-hyuk in the lead, they take down several Human B goons as they make their escape, stealing weapons from them as they go. Upon seeing Deputy Chief Lee around the corner, Joon-hyuk captures him at gunpoint and makes him explain Woo-jin\\u2019s presence at Human B.  Deputy Chief Lee smugly tells him that the Woo-jin in front of them is \\u201cCircle 8-III,\\u201d and confirms Jung-yeon\\u2019s suspicions that Woo-jin is a clone. Lee explains that the real Woo-jin died fifteen years ago, adding that they needed to reinsert the original Woo-jin\\u2019s memory into his clones in order for the cube technology to work. That\\u2019s why Circle 8-III looks exactly the same. As both Joon-hyuk and Woo-jin try to come to grips with what they\\u2019ve just heard \\u2014 Joon-hyuk taking in the fact that the brother he knew died, and Woo-jin the fact that despite having memories of the accident, he\\u2019s a clone \\u2014 Deputy Chief Lee secretly presses the panic button on his phone. \\u201cYou\\u2019re not Kim Woo-jin,\\u201d Lee says, pointing at the clone. \\u201cYou\\u2019re just the key that we need for the supercomputer. You\\u2019re a component.\\u201d  With that, Human B cronies are able to find them and corner them into the stairwell. Just when it starts to look hopeless for Joon-hyuk and Co., Chief Hong and cavalry come to the rescue just in time, though not without Hong taking a startled look at Woo-jin. Once they\\u2019re in the stairwell, Dong-soo can\\u2019t get over his shock to see Woo-jin, his old tutor, looking the same as he did twenty years ago. They all manage to leave the situation without any casualties, and regroup at their safe haven: the church.  Once all explanations have been made, it splits the group into two camps: Detective Oh and Joon-hyuk insist that Woo-jin is dead and that this clone is a substitute, but Jung-yeon and Dong-soo say that the person in front of them is Woo-jin. Dong-soo believes this especially, since Woo-jin remembers him, even though Detective Oh fires back, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve never met him before!\\u201d Joon-hyuk speaks up to agree with Detective Oh, asking repeatedly, \\u201cWhy is he Woo-jin? Woo-jin is dead. If he has the same face, is he Woo-jin? My little brother and your tutor is dead.\\u201d While looking Woo-jin dead in the eye, Joon-hyuk adds, \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t Woo-jin.\\u201d Ouch.  Thinking about Woo-jin\\u2019s goodbye video, Jung-yeon finally speaks up: \\u201cThis is what Woo-jin said: Because I have Han Jung-yeon\\u2019s memories, I am Han Jung-yeon. I lived as Han Jung-yeon all this time because of what he told me. So, he\\u2019s Woo-jin too. Because he has Woo-jin\\u2019s memories, he is Woo-jin.\\u201d \\u201cNo, Woo-jin is dead,\\u201d Joon-hyuk fires back. At first, he seems almost revolted by the thought that the Woo-jin in front of him isn\\u2019t the same brother that he once loved, and tears fill his eyes as he asks what would become of his dead brother if they were to accept that the person in front of them is Woo-jin. Walking straight up to Woo-jin, Joon-hyuk looks him in the eyes as he says,  \\u201cYou\\u2019re not Kim Woo-jin.\\u201d With that, Joon-hyuk leaves.  At Human B Headquarters, Minister/CEO Park holds a meeting of his top department researchers, who speculate about what will happen now that they no longer have Circle 8-III to activate the Care Chip technology. They predict mass chaos due to the blocked memories of all Smart Earth citizens returning. Minister Park declares that they can just make another clone, but since that would leave Smart Earth without the Care Chip technology for another year, their only remaining option is to capture Bluebird, Circle 8-III, and Joon-hyuk at any cost.  The city government, acting on Human B\\u2019s orders, places a terrorist watch on all three. Ho-soo tries to protest, saying that the real criminals are Minister Park and Human B. However, unbeknownst to him, his superior is one of Human B\\u2019s goons, so his protests fall on deaf ears. Having heard all the arguments going on in the church, Woo-jin understands both sides, and goes outside to process the information. Jung-yeon finds him on a bench, and when he asks if Bum-gyun woke up from his surgery successfully, she explains that he took ten years to wake up.  She tells him that Joon-hyuk\\u2019s memories of the past are entirely based on the memories Woo-jin left him just in case he never recovered from his amnesia, and so she adds that Joon-hyuk has been searching for his twin all these years just based on those precious few memories. Aww. After they realize they\\u2019ve been put on a terrorist watchlist, everyone furiously argues about the implications of keeping Woo-jin with them. Detective Oh thinks that if they\\u2019re with Woo-jin (who is not really Woo-jin in his mind), they\\u2019ll be in more danger. While this may be true because they know that Human B won\\u2019t stop until Woo-jin is back under their control, Jung-yeon tries to get them all to see reason: If they let Woo-jin go back to Human B, he\\u2019ll live a life as a prisoner and a tool for their use.  Woo-jin, having overheard their conversation, slowly walks outside, despondent but ready to sacrifice himself again for the good of the group. This time it\\u2019s Joon-hyuk who follows him outside and asks where he\\u2019s going. More flashes of a memory begin to form in Joon-hyuk\\u2019s mind, and he begins to remember bits and pieces of something that wasn\\u2019t in Woo-jin\\u2019s memory files. Remembering flashes of the last conversation they had before his surgery, Joon-hyuk asks the clone what Woo-jin said to him on that last day. But Woo-jin calls him \\u201cDetective Kim\\u201d and insists that the memories Joon-hyuk wants him to recount aren\\u2019t his memories, since he\\u2019s just a clone. But Joon-hyuk wants him to answer regardless, so Woo-jin repeats what he said that day in the hospital: \\u201cI\\u2019m\\u2026 scared.\\u201d The memory replays in Joon-hyuk\\u2019s mind as he remembers the rest of their final exchange. Before Woo-jin had left him for the last time, he made Bum-gyun promise not to forget him. After promising, both brothers had smiled at one another.  In the present, tears stream down both their faces as Woo-jin and Joon-hyuk take each other in. Using the same words he used twenty years ago, Woo-jin says, \\u201cHyung, I\\u2019m scared. I\\u2019ll\\u2026 be back.\\u201d This seems to break a dam inside Joon-hyuk, and he lets out all his frustration and sadness in a barrage of questions, asking him concernedly if he knew what he was doing when he left to see Professor Park. \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d Joon-hyuk finally says. \\u201cI shouldn\\u2019t have let you go alone. I\\u2019m sorry, Woo-jin-ah.\\u201d Embracing Woo-jin not as a clone, but as his true brother, Joon-hyuk cries as he apologizes over and over again. Woo-jin resists at first, clearly conflicted, but once he allows himself to say the word \\u201cHyung,\\u201d he gives into the embrace as he hugs his brother back.I\\u2019m always blown away by the pace of this show \\u2014 there\\u2019s barely any lag, and answers come almost as quickly as you can think of the questions. It\\u2019s a rare show that both outsmarts its viewers and respects their intelligence. And while we work our brains to keep up with the show, Circle repeatedly brings us back to the heart of its conceit: Who are we without our memories?  EPISODE 10 RECAP  It\\u2019s 2008, and Kim Kyu-chul comes home late one night, much to his mother\\u2019s surprise. Looking harried, he hands his mother something and tells her not to give it to anyone but him. He promises to come back again, and with one last solemn look, he hurries away from his home. His mother calls after him, then looks down at the wooden cross in her hand \\u2014 it\\u2019s the pen drive Kim Kyu-chul used to store his research. Part 1: Beta Project  Jung-yeon and Woo-jin are stunned to find Woo-jin\\u2019s memories preserved as footage on the computer in his father\\u2019s old office. As they watch, the Byul in Little Woo-jin\\u2019s memory hands him a star-shaped device and tells him that with its help, he can see his mom from his own memories. Jung-yeon wonders how she could have made such a thing while Woo-jin observes that anyone who discovers the existence of such technology would never be able to give up looking for it. With that scary thought in mind, the two turn to look at the screen again. In his office, Professor Park spies on the duo using the secret CCTV camera and gasps at the significance of what he just learned. But in the parking lot of the university later, Professor Park is kidnapped and brought to a darkened warehouse by the corrupt Detective Choi. There, he\\u2019s tied to a chair and questioned about the location of Professor Han.  The shadowy man in charge stands with his back to the interrogation while a surprisingly nonplussed Professor Park looks around and guesses that the people holding him now are representatives of \\u201cHuman B,\\u201d the shadowy foundation that funded Professor Han for many years. The shadowy man is surprised by his gumption, but he make it clear that Professor Park in no position to be asking questions. Seeing the effort Human B put into finding Professor Han, Professor Park baldly declares that he\\u2019s trying to decide whether or not he should hand over his discovery to them in an attempt to make a deal. Professor Park tells them about the system that stores memories as footage as a means of showing what he could bring to the table, but the man in charge scoffs at his claims of having found out how to make it work. Professor Park gains confidence as he points out how they failed in their attempts to mimic that technology, even going to the extent of killing students to make it work.  Feeling braver, Professor Park asks if Human B wants to keep hedging their bets on Professor Han, or if they\\u2019d like to join hands with him instead, since only he knows how to access the system. The man in charge turns to face him and asks what he wants. Professor Park asks to be untied, pointing out that as the sole person to know the secrets of the technology, he can neither be killed nor harmed. Later, as Professor Park stumbles down the road a free man, he recalls the man in charge telling him that they would be in touch. Sitting on the curb, Professor Park grins to himself: \\u201cLife sure has a funny way of working out.\\u201d Woo-jin stands in the yard of his childhood home trying to come to terms with what he just learned. But just then, he gets a call from a hysterical Min-young saying that Bum-gyun can no longer recognize her. Trying but failing to calm Min-young down, Woo-jin just promises her that he\\u2019ll find a way to help his brother before heading back inside.  Sitting in a corner of the office, Jung-yeon wonders if she really was an alien and why she came here. She rallies when Woo-jin comes in, though he immediately sets to pulling external hard drives from his bag. He tells Jung-yeon that even if he doesn\\u2019t know how to use this program to help his brother, he knows that he\\u2019s the key to making it work. For now, his intentions are to preserve his own memories, so that if there comes a day when Bum-gyun can no longer remember anything, Woo-jin can show Bum-gyun his own memory footage. When they reach Min-young\\u2019s dad\\u2019s hospital, they walk in to find Bum-gyun\\u2019s room empty. Panicked, Woo-jin and Jung-yeon run all over the place looking for him, until they spot Bum-gyun cheerily waving at them from a bench in a nearby park. Bum-gyun hails Woo-jin, but then looks at Jung-yeon carefully.  Woo-jin moves in front of her protectively, but Bum-gyun just erupts in a wide grin as he guesses that whoever-she-is must be Woo-jin\\u2019s girlfriend. Bum-gyun introduces himself in an uncannily playful and carefree way as Woo-jin and Jung-yeon look at each other in surprised dismay. Min-young approaches them with a bicycle, and at first, there seems to be a glimmer of hope when Bum-gyun hails Min-young by her name. But then Bum-gyun introduces her as the friendly daughter of the hospital\\u2019s director that he just met, explaining that Min-young asked him to teach her how to ride a bike. For her part, Min-young exchanges a glance with Woo-jin, quietly asking him to play along.  After an initial push, Min-young slowly pedals away under her own power. Bum-gyun observes that she\\u2019s quite good, but upon noticing Woo-jin\\u2019s distracted look, he slowly slides behind his brother. With a sly grin, he hits the back of Woo-jin\\u2019s knees with his own, only to run away laughing like the happiest kid in the world after Woo-jin stumbles in surprise. Woo-jin watches his brother with an amazed smile on his face, which Jung-yeon notes uneasily.  Back inside the hospital, Woo-jin takes a seat next to Jung-yeon and asks if they should just stop now. \\u201cMy brother is smiling,\\u201d Woo-jin says suddenly. \\u201cMy brother was uneasy every day since Dad went missing, but\\u2026 he\\u2019s smiling now.\\u201d Looking at Jung-yeon directly, Woo-jin adds that Bum-gyun doesn\\u2019t remember her, so that means he doesn\\u2019t remember anything about aliens or their dad. Hopeful now, he asks Jung-yeon if they can\\u2019t just go away somewhere with Bum-gyun and start anew. Having overheard that last part, Min-young rushes up to confront Woo-jin over what he just said. When Woo-jin confesses that he thinks Bum-gyun might be happier this way, Min-young asks if Bum-gyun ever said that he wanted to be rid of his memories (the implication being that Bum-gyun has no way to decide for himself). \\u201cDo you know your brother so little?\\u201d Min-young asks.  Woo-jin: \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s because I know him that I\\u2019m saying this! My brother has been through so much already. After Dad disappeared, he was miserable for ten years. Why would I try to restore those bad memories?\\u201d Min-young: \\u201cBecause those memories are Bum-gyun! Bum-gyun is only Bum-gyun because he has Bum-gyun\\u2019s memories!\\u201d Min-young asks how it can be all right for Bum-gyun to be happy without his memories, adding that Bum-gyun doesn\\u2019t even recognize her now, which means he might not recognize Woo-jin tomorrow. In shocked disbelief, Min-young accuses Woo-jin of giving up in the face of the much harder task of recovering Bum-gyun\\u2019s memories. She turns to Jung-yeon and asks if she agrees with Woo-jin, clearly looking for an ally. Struggling with her own doubts about recovering old memories, Jung-yeon can only look at Min-young as she answers, \\u201cI\\u2026 don\\u2019t know.\\u201d  Later, Jung-yeon comes to sit beside a sleeping Bum-gyun, wondering who she is now without her own past memories. \\u201cBum-gyun-ah,\\u201d she thinks to herself, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what the right answer is.\\u201d Over the phone, Professor Park urges Lee Sunbae to place his trust in him and do as he says. After he hangs up, Professor Park gets a call from a restricted number \\u2014 it\\u2019s the shadowy man from Human B, and he agrees to Park\\u2019s offer. Acting like he has the upper hand, Professor Park tells the shadowy man to do what must be done. As if on cue, Chief Hong suddenly finds his access to the evidence room restricted. He punches the policeman blocking him from the room, but this only earns him a suspension from the section chief. Woo-jin asks Min-young\\u2019s doctor father to remove the bug from Bum-gyun\\u2019s brain, but Dad says that it\\u2019s impossible to do without more information about how the worm works. Before Woo-jin can plead with him further, a group of men carrying the signature search-and-seizure blue boxes enter the office and seize the doctor\\u2019s personal and patient records, citing a likely trumped-up embezzlement charge.  Back in Bum-gyun\\u2019s room, a nurse comes in and tells Jung-yeon that they\\u2019ll be performing a few tests after he administers an injection. Jung-yeon points out that Bum-gyun is still sleeping, but this only nets a reassuring smile from the nurse, who proceeds to inject the drug anyway. Chief Hong arrives at the hospital while the search and seizure is going on. As he speaks to Woo-jin, Min-young runs to them and says that the men are also taking all the patient records, including Bum-gyun\\u2019s. Chief Hong is instantly suspicious, since an investigation of embezzlement would have nothing to do with a patient\\u2019s test results. He wonders aloud if someone is trying to get rid of the evidence at the hospital just like they did at the police station. At Woo-jin and Min-young\\u2019s panicked expressions, Chief Hong tells them about being suspended, and how no one at his station even bothered looking into the corrupt Detective Choi.  The nurse tells Jung-yeon that he\\u2019s taking Bum-gyun out for an MRI. It\\u2019s only after he\\u2019s wheeled out Bum-gyun that Jung-yeon remembers that MRIs can\\u2019t be performed on patients with metal in their body, meaning that Bum-gyun should be excluded because of the chipped bug in his brain. Jung-yeon runs out into the corridor and finds the nurse waiting with the stretcher by the elevators. This time, she notices his suit pants and shoes sticking out of his scrubs, which raises a lot of red flags. She hides just out of sight and calls Woo-jin. Chief Hong tells Woo-jin and Min-young that \\u201cthey\\u201d might try to target Bum-gyun, since he\\u2019s the most decisive piece of evidence. Just then, Woo-jin gets Jung-yeon\\u2019s call, and she tells him that the fake nurse has Bum-gyun and is waiting by the tenth floor elevator with the down button pressed.  Woo-jin and the others run down the stairs, racing to reach the basement parking lot before the fake nurse does. When he wheels Bum-gyun out of the elevator, there is already an ambulance and another fake nurse waiting to transfer Bum-gyun inside. Suddenly, compressed air hits them in the face as Woo-jin and Chief Hong emerge from around the ambulance wielding fire extinguishers. As the fake nurses cough out their lungs, Woo-jin and Min-young push the gurney away as Chief Hong runs ahead to bring out his own car for their getaway. Before they can get Bum-gyun inside, the fake nurses come running and try to get hold of the gurney. Min-young throws herself at one of the men while Chief Hong throws himself at the other, and thinking fast, Woo-jin picks Bum-gyun up and hurriedly places him in the backseat. As Jung-yeon comes running, Chief Hong tells her to take the wheel and drive while he and Min-young hold the abductor nurses at bay.  They get away in the car, and Professor Park has a tantrum about it on the phone. Changing tactics, he directs his new ally to leave them be for now. Once they\\u2019re parked elsewhere, Woo-jin becomes worried that Bum-gyun\\u2019s waking up. Jung-yeon tells him that he\\u2019s been sedated, but Woo-jin can\\u2019t help but panic as he looks at Bum-gyun\\u2019s still form. Jung-yeon takes Woo-jin\\u2019s face in her hands and steadies him by reminding him that they have to stay calm and protect Bum-gyun: \\u201cYou\\u2019re all he has, after all.\\u201d He nods and slowly clasps her hands in his, drawing her hands away.  Woo-jin gets a call from Professor Park, who lies that he just barely managed to escape after being kidnapped by Professor Han. He warns Woo-jin that Han might be after Bum-gyun and asks to meet with him right away. When Woo-jin arrives on a street alone to meet Professor Park, he notices his professor\\u2019s hand trembling. Park gets tearful as he apologizes to Woo-jin and lies that Professor Han had forced him to meet with and convince Woo-jin of something. He tells Woo-jin that more than Professor Han, he\\u2019s scared of the people behind him \\u2014 the mysterious Human B, which has been funding a search for Byul\\u2019s technology for years. Woo-jin asks if Professor Han wants his dad\\u2019s research, but Professor Park says that Han has given up on that. Instead, he says only that Professor Han wants to continue his research on Byul with Woo-jin, as he had done with his father, Kim Kyu-chul, before. Professor Park tries to convince him that that\\u2019s the only way Bum-gyun can regain his memories.  Woo-jin understands that what this really means is that he\\u2019s being told to bring Bum-gyun and Jung-yeon to Professor Han. Professor Park adds a final threat \\u201cfrom Professor Han:\\u201d Woo-jin has nowhere to run to anymore. As Professor Park examines Woo-jin\\u2019s face with fake concern, Woo-jin relents and asks for just one more day. Agreeing to convey that message to Professor Han, Professor Park watches as Woo-jin walks away into the night, a calculating expression on his face. Woo-jin ends up in his dad\\u2019s old office, and the computer switches on again in his presence. \\u201cIs there really no way out of this? Do Jung-yeon and I really have to go?\\u201d he wonders to himself. Remembering how the program answered his question about his memories, he asks it if his dad\\u2019s research even exists. The program does nothing, and with growing frustration, Woo-jin shouts, \\u201cIs there really nothing that Dad left behind?\\u201d  That\\u2019s when the program shows him a moment from his childhood, when he had walked into the same office and found Byul sitting at the desk. As Woo-jin sighs in frustration at the apparently useless memory, his gaze suddenly snags on the cross-shaped USB drive on the desk. His eyes widen as he remembers seeing that cross amongst his grandmother\\u2019s belongings, and he runs out of the house. Meanwhile, in his office, Professor Park looks in on the moment with a frown. Woo-jin arrives at the hospice room and approaches his grandmother cautiously. She looks at him curiously, but when he asks if Dad gave her the cross hanging around her neck, she flies into a panic and calls for the nurse. On his knees next to her, Woo-jin finally just breaks down in frustration and begs her to give him the necklace, crying that it\\u2019s the only way for him to save Bum-gyun.  As Grandma sees him crying, his head buried in her blanket, she seems to remember him again. She touches his hair softly and asks where Bum-gyun is. Woo-jin raises his head and promises that if she gave him that necklace, he\\u2019ll bring his brother back safe and sound. She takes off the cross and hands it to him, and Woo-jin tearfully thanks his grandmother. Woo-jin reaches his studio apartment and plugs the USB drive into his laptop. A video screen opens, but it only shows static. Possibly thinking that the file is corrupted, Woo-jin repeatedly presses buttons until frustration gets to him and he gives up. \\u201cIs there really no other way?\\u201d he wonders, defeated. Just then, his father appears on screen, sitting in a room where the walls are papered with post-it notes. He introduces himself and titles this as his last entry on the Beta Project. With hope lighting in his eyes, Woo-jin whispers, \\u201cI found it. I found it, Hyung.\\u201d  Part 2: Brave New World  Professor Han tells Jung-yeon and Joon-hyuk that Woo-jin was killed by Minister Park. As Joon-hyuk grapples with the devastating news, the mad Professor Han frowns in confusion and adds that it was a perfectly scientific death (he even goes into grisly details), but if it was, he doesn\\u2019t know how Human B could still be working. There\\u2019s only so much of Professor Han\\u2019s gibberish that Joon-hyuk can take, as he demands to know what Han means. Professor Han cackles as he says that the supercomputer can\\u2019t work without Woo-jin, but since it is working, does that mean Woo-jin is alive? \\u201cNo, he\\u2019s dead,\\u201d Professor Han finally concludes, causing Joon-hyuk to almost choke him in frustration as he screams, \\u201cIs Woo-jin alive or dead?!\\u201d Professor Han shoves him away and continues his rambling line of thought as he wonders if Minister Park found a way to run the supercomputer by himself. Jumping from one thought to the next, Han wonders if Woo-jin could possibly be alive, before once again concluding that it would be scientifically impossible. Only, a smile touches his face as Han examines a new thought: \\u201cOr\\u2026 is it possible? Is resurrection possible?\\u201d  Joon-hyuk and Jung-yeon leave Professor Han\\u2019s room and discuss what they learned outside. Joon-hyuk remembers that Byul\\u2019s star only recognized Woo-jin, so it makes sense that he would be the only one able to operate the system. This naturally leads them to realize that if Human B doesn\\u2019t work without Woo-jin, then it must mean that Minister Park couldn\\u2019t crack the secret of the system even in the twenty years he\\u2019s had it. \\u201cThen where is Woo-jin?\\u201d Joon-hyuk asks. Secretary Shin\\u2019s phone rings, and Ho-soo sees that it\\u2019s Deputy Chief Lee. He hands her the phone at gunpoint and tells her to answer normally. She seems to do exactly as she says as she tells Deputy Chief Lee that her sister Seo-hee is ill and that she\\u2019ll get back to him later.  When she hangs up, Deputy Chief Lee tells his men to look for Secretary Shin, because her sister\\u2019s name isn\\u2019t Seo-hee. (Ah, smart.) His men locate her outside Professor Han\\u2019s residence, and Lee reports the kidnapping to Minister Park. He directs Deputy Chief Lee to use an Ultra High Frequency (UHF) network to communicate so that they can avoid all the Smart Earth technology that Bluebird can hack into. Ho-soo gets the order on his comm along with other security personnel, and after shooting an accusatory look at Secretary Shin, he goes inside to warn Joon-hyuk and Jung-yeon. Jung-yeon is arguing that they have to infiltrate the Human B building if Woo-jin is inside, while Joon-hyuk says that it\\u2019s too dangerous. But Ho-soo offers an alternate plan.  We find Chief Hong and Detective Ha occupying two benches at the Smart Earth terminal as they wait for word from Joon-hyuk. Dong-soo arrives and tells them about the directive that just went out over the UHF network to catch Bluebird alive. Together, the three realize that Joon-hyuk and Jung-yeon\\u2019s location must have been compromised, and they wonder if they can get inside Smart Earth somehow. Security personnel with their stun wands creep closer to Professor Han\\u2019s building, when suddenly, a car careens out of the driveway. They call it in, and a barricade is placed further down the route to stop the car.  It\\u2019s Ho-soo behind the wheel, and he drives straight at them before punching the break at the last possible moment. The personnel converge on the car and arrest Ho-soo. Sadly, the only person in the backseat is Secretary Shin. Ha! As they help Secretary Shin emerge from the car, she says that there\\u2019s a way to find out where Bluebird is. Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Lee is furious to find out that Ho-soo has been playing him, and Minister Park orders him to check Ho-soo\\u2019s memory footage immediately. Ho-soo is brought back to the Investigation Unit, and Secretary Shin tells him that they\\u2019ll be reconnecting his chip to Human B again. \\u201cYou failed in what you tried to do,\\u201d she tells him, and a tear slips out of Ho-soo\\u2019s eyes. Aww.  Minister Park watches with vulture-like interest as the connection to Ho-soo\\u2019s chip is reestablished in Human B\\u2019s control room as he waits for Ho-soo\\u2019s memory to be checked. But suddenly, Bluebird\\u2019s logo populates the towering screen above them, and he\\u2019s told that there\\u2019s a virus infecting Human B\\u2019s computer network. Reeling in disbelief, Minister Park wonders how a virus could get in when Human B is completely disconnected from any outside server. Then, he notes how Ho-soo is staring straight and unnervingly at Secretary Shin, whose eyes Minister Park is currently using to watch the situation. Only then does Minister Park realize that the virus was in Ho-soo\\u2019s Care Chip. As Minister Park glares down at Ho-soo on the monitor, Ho-soo looks up at Secretary shin, a victorious smile tugging at his lips.  In flashback, we watch the trio discussing Ho-soo\\u2019s plan. Ho-soo tells them to let Human B capture him, since they would immediately reconnect him chip to check his memories for their whereabouts. Jung-yeon immediately catches on, but says that it\\u2019s too dangerous. The non-tech-savvy Joon-hyuk asks them to speak clearly, and Ho-soo explains that if he were to be captured, Bluebird/Jung-yeon could hack into Human B\\u2019s security system. He tells them that the supercomputer is on the 99th floor, and this is the only way they have any hope of getting inside. The risks are high, since they know that once Human B realizes what Ho-soo has done, they will likely block Ho-soo\\u2019s memories. Looking at Jung-yeon, Ho-soo asks her to promise that once this is over, she\\u2019ll return his memories to him.  Joon-hyuk is reluctant to risk his friend\\u2019s life or memory, but seeing that there is no other way, he puts a hand on Ho-soo\\u2019s shoulder and says, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never said this before, but thank you, Lee Ho-soo.\\u201d Ho-soo smiles and says that no matter what else he may forget, he should remember this moment, since it\\u2019s the first time he\\u2019s heard these words from Joon-hyuk. In the present, Deputy Chief Lee has his people seal off all entry points to the Human B building. With the security system disabled due to the virus, Jung-yeon and Joon-hyuk are able to sneak into the Human B building through the basement. They find the door\\u2019s automation down, and Joon-hyuk is impressed at how well her virus worked.  But since they can\\u2019t get through the door the regular way, Joon-hyuk pulls a crowbar from his bag and says, \\u201cYou\\u2019re digital and I\\u2019m analog. What do you think? Aren\\u2019t we a great team?\\u201d They grin at each other, and Joon-hyuk gets to work on the door the old-fashioned way. Minister Park asks for an update on the virus, and when he\\u2019s assured that it\\u2019ll be removed soon, he turns to Deputy Chief Lee and directs him to check on \\u201cCircle 8.\\u201d Joon-hyuk and Jung-yeon make it up ninety-nine floors on foot. Nearly out of breath, they pause a moment at the door leading to the 99th Floor and look at each other. With a nod, Joon-hyuk pulls open the door, only to come face-to-face with a small army, all of them pointing their guns directly at them.  Minister Park walks up to them and smugly tells Jung-yeon that she should have called if she missed him. He orders her to be taken away, and as the personnel grab her, Joon-hyuk pushes his head against the barrel of a gun daringly as he points out that men with chips in their head can\\u2019t shoot people. Minister Park laughs at his cleverness, only to remind him that he has no chip in his head moments before he takes a gun and points it straight at Joon-hyuk. At this very real threat, Jung-yeon immediately stops struggling and agrees to go with them. As Joon-hyuk yells after Jung-yeon, they drag him away and lock him in a room. Jung-yeon is taken to a bare room with a laptop on a desk that\\u2019s running Byul\\u2019s memory program. As Minister Park walks in, Jung-yeon observes that he used Woo-jin and the star to make Human B work for all these years, doing nothing on his own merit.  Minister Park admits that Woo-jin is the most important component of the supercomputer. As Jung-yeon yells that Woo-jin is a human being and not a component, Minister Park taunts her for judging him, when she\\u2019s been hiding this whole time \\u2014 if she really cared about Woo-jin, shouldn\\u2019t she have come sooner? He adds that Byul\\u2019s memories hold secrets that can give new technologies to humankind, but while Jung-yeon went around unblocking other people\\u2019s memories, she never tried to access the memories that Kim Kyu-chul locked away. \\u201cWhy am I forcing Woo-jin to make the sacrifice? Because you won\\u2019t,\\u201d he finally tells Jung-yeon. \\u201cIf you want to help Woo-jin, then regain your memories. All you have to do is sacrifice yourself instead.\\u201d  A man in a surgeon\\u2019s gown and mask pushes a cart topped with menacing-looking equipment and, worst of all, a Care Chip. Realizing what\\u2019s about to happen to her, Jung-yeon sits heavily in her chair, and as her eyes fall on the chip, tears slip down her face. Minister Park waits with a smug smile as the surgeon brings a scalpel toward Jung-yeon\\u2019s neck. Noooo! But just before the blade can touch her skin, all the lights suddenly shut off. Ordering the men not to lose Jung-yeon, Minister Park runs down to the control room. There, he\\u2019s told that the supercomputer is frozen, but not because of the virus. Deputy Chief Lee rushes in to tell Minister Park that \\u201cCircle 8\\u201d has disappeared. Stuck in the locked room, Joon-hyuk suddenly realizes that the lights on the door panel are turned off. He turns the knob, and the door opens easily. Avoiding Human B\\u2019s by hiding in the shadows, he slowly creeps out through the corridors and makes his way to the stairwell.  At the Smart Earth terminal, security stops people from going in as they blame it on a system error. Dong-soo realizes that this means that the supercomputer must be down, and Chief Hong gets his men to cause a commotion so that they can get inside. Mingling with the impatient crowd, they begin to stir panic and anger until everyone pushes through the barrier in a rush to get inside the city. Joon-hyuk must have been incarcerated at a lower level, because we find him running up the stairs to the 99th floor again. Exhausted but determined, he asks Woo-jin to wait for him. Jung-yeon uses the scalpel on the tray beside her to injure her guard and get away. She runs out to the stairwell too, and when she finds Joon-hyuk, she tells him that the supercomputer is frozen, which can only mean that the connection between Woo-jin and the system was somehow severed. Fearing the worst, they run up the stairs together.  Deputy Chief Lee, Minister Park, and their henchmen take the emergency elevator up, while our heroes trudge laboriously up the steps again. Suddenly, Joon-hyuk stops Jung-yeon by putting a protective hand out in front of her. The sound of slow footsteps reaches them as someone descends the steps above them. As the person comes in view, Joon-hyuk and Jung-yeon can only stare up in shock. A tear rolls down Jung-yeon\\u2019s face, but we can\\u2019t see whatever they\\u2019re seeing. \\u201cKim Woo-jin,\\u201d breathes Joon-hyuk, barely able to believe his eyes. \\u201cIs it really you?\\u201dJust when you think Circle is out of surprises, it finds ways to shock us with new revelations in both timelines as the gap between past and present continues to close inch by inch. While both timelines yield reunions this episode, all is not as it seems\\u2014and as the sinister Human B project begins to take more shape in the present, even Woo-jin can\\u2019t help but acknowledge the implications that the technology could have. The question is whether it should.  EPISODE 9 RECAP  Little Woo-jin is hard at work creating a chalk drawing of a female face on the ground. He draws and erases, then he draws and erases again, and finally he throws down his chalk, seeming unsatisfied with his work. When Byul approaches and asks him what\\u2019s wrong, a now-crying Little Woo-jin replies that he\\u2019s trying to draw his mother, but he can\\u2019t seem to remember her anymore. Byul asks if he would like to see his mother again, and he nods before returning to his crude drawing. Part 1: Beta Project  Woo-jin finds Bum-gyun unconscious on the floor, and thinking that he\\u2019s dead, he frantically tries to shake him awake, calling him again and again. Bum-gyun stirs and mumbles \\u201cWoo-jin, I\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d which causes Woo-jin\\u2019s eyes to widen in shock and he starts apologizing to his brother in return. Unbeknownst to the reunited brothers, a blinking star stuck on the ceiling activates some sort of electronic system on Kim Kyu-chul\\u2019s computer.  Min-young, Chief Hong, and Professor Park enter the room to find the twins soon afterward. Min-young and Chief Hong rush to the brothers in order to transport Bum-gyun to the hospital immediately. But Professor Park notices the star on the ceiling and finds it suspicious, and when he sees the computer that\\u2019s suddenly turned on by itself with \\u201cAccess Permit\\u201d flashing across its monitor, his curiosity is ignited. Min-young says that they should go to Min Medical Center, which is her father\\u2019s hospital, and so she and Chief Hong begin to carry Bum-gyun outside to the car. The injured Woo-jin is the last to follow, and as he leaves the room, Professor Park notices the monitor flash the word \\u201cDisconnect\\u201d before shutting off. On the way to the hospital, Professor Park keeps pondering the meaning of the blinking star and the self-activating computer. Woo-jin tells the group that Detective Choi is on Professor Han\\u2019s side, which leads Chief Hong to shout the order to search for both Detective Choi and Professor Han into his police radio.  As soon as they arrive at the hospital, Min-young tells her dad that Bum-gyun needs surgery immediately to take out a blue bug in his brain, and he\\u2019s rushed to the operating room. Outside, Min-young reassures Woo-jin that Bum-gyun is in good hands, while he tries to tell her that she should get checked out as well (since she also has a blue bug in her head). Min-young insists that she knows her own condition best since she\\u2019s been monitoring it, adding that the location of the bug isn\\u2019t life-threatening since she hasn\\u2019t experienced any of the traditional headache-nosebleed symptoms yet. Woo-jin still looks like he wants her to get treated, but she puts an end to the conversation by telling him that they need to get her father to fully concentrate on operating on Bum-gyun before treating her, because whatever saves him could eventually help her. She then enters the OR, leaving Woo-jin, Professor Park, and Chief Hong outside.  Woo-jin thanks Professor Park for giving him the tip about Bum-gyun\\u2019s location, and Professor Park apologizes for not recognizing him sooner as Kim Kyu-chul\\u2019s son. He goes on to explain the history between him, Kyu-chul, and Professor Han, adding that they all did research together in their college days. Taking Woo-jin\\u2019s hands, Professor Park tells him just how sorry he is as he claims that had he known, he would have put a stop to Professor Han\\u2019s terrible experiments. \\u201cI really had no idea,\\u201d he lies. Chief Hong asks some questions about how and what Professor Park knew about Bum-gyun\\u2019s holding location, and Park is able to deflect and make the guilty party (Professor Han) look even guiltier. Speaking of whom, Professor Han is on the run, and he orders someone on the phone to clear out all his experimental data.  We find Jung-yeon in a room in the hospital that her father locked her up in, without a way out. But being the resourceful girl she is, as soon as she hears footsteps, she finds a toothbrush and breaks it in half to create a serviceable weapon. Professor Han enters the room and orders her to come along, but as soon he turns his back to her, she takes a breath, ready to use her makeshift weapon on him. Her plans are interrupted when she\\u2019s suddenly faced by a burly and threatening orderly and she\\u2019s forced to follow Professor Han. Once they\\u2019re in a car driving, she asks where they\\u2019re going, but he just gives vague answers, claiming that he only wants to keep her safe. Taking a chance with her life, she jumps out the car and rolls onto the road.  Alarmed, Professor Han slams on his brakes and gets out to see if she\\u2019s all right. She stands up, a cut bleeding from her forehead, and points the sharp-edged toothbrush at him. Confronted with a weapon, he puts his hands up and tries to calm her down, but Jung-yeon isn\\u2019t having it, even as she pleads with him to stop. \\u201cThis is for the sake of humanity!\\u201d Professor Han stresses, adding that once they have Byul\\u2019s memories, they can create a brave new world together. But Jung-yeon cries that she just wants to live as his daughter, though her father doesn\\u2019t seem that sorry when he tells her that that would be impossible now.  Before they can explore this conversation in-depth, Professor Han spies a traffic cam recording them as well as a police car coming down the road. He tries to grab Jung-yeon to force her back into the car, but she slashes him with her weapon, causing spurts of blood to spout from his wrist. She looks horrified by what she\\u2019s done, but she keeps the weapon pointed at him. As the cop car comes closer, Professor Han grows more frantic and abandons Jung-yeon to make his escape. The cops pull up beside Jung-yeon as her father drives off into the distance, and she\\u2019s left sitting on the side of the road, bleeding and crying.  Woo-jin\\u2019s phone rings\\u2014it\\u2019s Jung-yeon, calling from a stranger\\u2019s phone. Woo-jin asks how everything went, and she lies and says that everything is fine, although he thinks something\\u2019s off because she\\u2019s calling from a different number. Repeating that everything is fine, Jung-yeon asks where he is and whether he found his brother, and when he replies, she says she\\u2019ll meet him there. However, when she hangs up, she stumbles in a moment of dizziness.  At Min Hospital, Bum-gyun wakes up, and Woo-jin asks whether he remembers his captor to be Professor Han. After a moment of confusion, Woo-jin looks at the photograph, and his eyes alight as he confirms that Professor Han was indeed his kidnapper. Back at the police station, Chief Hong ransacks Detective Choi\\u2019s things, only to realize that all the case files related to the twins\\u2019 case and Professor Han are gone. Detective Choi has cleared out all the evidence, and the scene cuts to his present location.  We find Detective Choi in a darkly lit building as he meets a menacing-looking man with wire-rimmed glasses. The detective reports that Professor Han is probably already heading to the location the menacing-looking man mentioned, netting an ambiguous response from the shadowy figure. Professor Han flexes the wrist that Jung-yeon cut as Lee Sunbae calls to tell him that all the research material has been moved to their meeting place. It\\u2019s a small trailer room in the middle of nowhere, but when Professor Han comes inside, there\\u2019s one more person than expected: Professor Park, who tells Lee Sunbae to wait for them outside while the adults talk.  After Lee Sunbae leaves,  Professor Park asks what Professor Han did to Bum-gyun, and Han unapologetically replies that Bum-gyun\\u2019s memories will slowly be erased\\u2014if not, he\\u2019d have to kill him in order to prevent Bum-gyun from talking. Grabbing Professor Han by the collar, Professor Park demands to know what Professor Han hoped to achieve by using the brain bots he designed to experiment on kids. The mad scientist within Professor Han comes out again as he goes off on another manic high while explaining how he\\u2019s spent the last ten years trying to replicate Kim Kyu-chul and Byul\\u2019s ability to quantify and manipulate memory without any success. He tries to persuade Professor Park to his side by citing the future possibilities that type of technology could achieve, which he claims could open up an entirely new world. Learning now what Professor Han has been after this entire time with his illegal experimentations, Professor Park remembers the blinking light that came on from the ceiling star when he went to Kim Kyu-chul\\u2019s old house.  Professor Park\\u2019s expression changes, and the next thing we see is him walking hurriedly outside while carrying all of Professor Han\\u2019s data in a box. Lee Sunbae asks him what happened, and Professor Park just tells him that they have to work together from now on. Professor Park explains that because both of them were primary researchers on Professor Han\\u2019s team, they\\u2019ll probably also become innocent targets of public hate if his illegal experiments on students ever come to light. He adds that if that ever happens, their careers are over. Suddenly distressed after realizing the larger implications, Lee Sunbae starts nodding furiously when Professor Park asks for his trust, and for him to keep an eye on Professor Han in the meantime. Inside the trailer, we see that Professor Park has tied Professor Han to a chair with duct tape. After going back to Kyu-chul\\u2019s old house, Professor Park tries to activate the blinking star again, but the computer keeps showing the \\u201cAccess Denied\\u201d message. Thinking back, Professor Park wonders if perhaps Woo-jin is the trigger mechanism for the system.  At the hospital, Woo-jin shows Chief Hong to Bum-gyun\\u2019s room so that he can provide the detective with his personal witness testimony. However, when shown a picture of Professor Han again, Bum-gyun can\\u2019t seem to recall him, even though he was able to point the man out as his kidnapper when he just woke up. The last thing Bum-gyun says he remembers about his pursuit of the case is that Bluebird is the culprit, and he sounds very much like he\\u2019s regressed back to being the old, paranoid Bum-gyun. Woo-jin looks utterly crestfallen as he sees that his brother is losing his memory retroactively. When he consults with Min-young\\u2019s father/the neurosurgeon who operated on Bum-gyun regarding the status of his brother\\u2019s brain, he\\u2019s informed that the retrograde amnesia is due to the blue bug that wasn\\u2019t completely extracted during surgery. The neurosurgeon explains that the bug has burrowed its way to a critical place in the brain that\\u2019s difficult to reach with surgery without possibly paralyzing or blinding Bum-gyun for life.  Jung-yeon arrives at the hospital and spots Woo-jin down the hallway. She calls his name loudly and runs toward him, but instead of comforting her or even asking about her end of the situation, Woo-jin immediately jumps asks if she knows where her father is. He explains that he wants to know because his brother\\u2019s condition would be best explained and perhaps reversed by the scientist who initially implanted the bug in Bum-gyun\\u2019s brain in the first place.  Knowing that Bum-gyun\\u2019s life may be on the line, Jung-yeon cries as she explains that she feels like she\\u2019s made a mistake by not grabbing ahold of her father and keeping him until the cops arrived, and she breaks down in tears. Seeing her cry, Woo-jin finally takes stock of Jung-yeon\\u2019s injuries and his empathetic side comes out as he places both hands gently on her shoulders to comfort her. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not your fault,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI probably would\\u2019ve run away if I were you, too.\\u201d Much more gently now, Woo-jin adds that they\\u2019ll work together to find Professor Han, since that\\u2019s the best chance they have to save Bum-gyun.  Back in his office, Professor Park furrows his brow as he surveys the CCTV reel of Kyu-chul\\u2019s old home office, failing to determine the trigger for the star-computer activation system. When Jung-yeon and Woo-jin barge in through the doors, Professor Park hastily puts the laptop with the live footage away. They ask whether he\\u2019s ever seen one of the blue bugs before while working under Professor Han. Of course Professor Park has, what with being the creator of the bugs, but he denies all knowledge in front of his two students. In a subtle prompt, Professor Park adds that although he knows nothing about the blue bugs, Kyu-chul\\u2019s old house might contain the clues they\\u2019re looking for. They thank the professor for his help on finding this new lead, and as soon as they leave his office, Professor Park whips out his laptop to watch their progress unfold.  Jung-yeon and Woo-jin arrive at Woo-jin\\u2019s old house and enter his father\\u2019s office. Inside, they finally notice the blinking star that activates the main computer. Without any additional input, the computer starts playing a video of Woo-jin\\u2019s most recent impactful memory of Jung-yeon crying at the hospital in front of him. Both Woo-jin and Jung-yeon are stunned as they try to comprehend what they\\u2019re seeing, and Woo-jin can only mutter, \\u201cThis is\\u2026 my memory.\\u201d When Professor Park watches the CCTV footage in real time and realizes that what Professor Han had been babbling about\\u2014memory storage and manipulation\\u2014wasn\\u2019t the ravings of a lunatic after all, his mind reels.  When Woo-jin asks how any of this is possible, the computer processes his request and replays an earlier memory of Byul. In the memory, which is a continuation of the chalk scene at the top of the episode, Byul gives him the star (calling it a \\u201cmemory box\\u201d) and tells him to use it whenever he wants to see his mother again. Jung-yeon is hit by the fact that before she lost her own memories, she had the ability to create something so powerful. Half in shock, Woo-jin reluctantly admits, \\u201cI finally understand why Professor Han tried so hard\\u2026 to bring back your memory.\\u201d He says the last part as though chagrined by the thought, but even he can\\u2019t deny that any scientist who saw what they just saw would never give up. After listing all the possibilities of this technology, ranging from treating mental illnesses to changing the fundamentals of how society operates, Woo-jin seems to realize how that all sounds. But now he understands why Professor Han, or any other scientist, would be driven to pursue the technology. Part 2: Brave New World  At the midnight standoff between Joon-hyuk and Minister Park, Joon-hyuk tearfully asks where his brother is. \\u201cIs he even alive?\\u201d he asks, and a smiling Minister Park informs him that he\\u2019s alive and living well. But now, Joon-hyuk wants to know why he took Woo-jin, wondering why Minister Park couldn\\u2019t have just let Woo-jin go after getting the information he wanted from him. \\u201cWoo-jin wanted it too,\\u201d Minister Park replies, seeming to enjoy the reaction this gets out of Joon-hyuk. \\u201cYou know that this all started with Woo-jin. We came this far because Woo-jin wanted it to happen.\\u201d While Joon-hyuk can only breathe in shock, we see that Deputy Chief Lee is surveying the situation from Human B headquarters through the instant memory replay of one of Minister Park\\u2019s ineffectual bodyguards.  Deputy Chief Lee commands Secretary Shin to take care of the situation, and when they arrive on scene, Joon-hyuk quickly takes Minister Park hostage with a gun to his head. Joon-hyuk threatens to shoot unless the others back off, but Minister Park doesn\\u2019t seem all that fazed\\u2014after all, he says, Joon-hyuk needs him alive if he hopes to ever find Woo-jin. And that way, Minister Park can get what he wants, too: Jung-yeon (aka Bluebird). A guard attacks Joon-hyuk from behind, breaking his hold on the minister. He\\u2019s able to subdue the guard and use him as a shield to buy him a few seconds before being chased by Minister Park\\u2019s cronies. When he\\u2019s back at Human B, Minister Park orders that Bluebird be caught by any means necessary. Pictures of Jung-yeon are sent to every Smart Earth Human B security personnel member so that they can track her down.  They start implementing a system of in-person facial screenings instead of the usual quicker Care Chip checks in order to let people move between Ordinary Earth and Smart Earth. The citizens grumble about the inconveniences, but in a private conversation with Secretary Shin, Deputy Chief Lee reveals how big the implications for this seemingly minor change are: By instituting these facial checks, Human B has implicitly acknowledged a failure in their supposed \\u201cperfect\\u201d system and has tainted their own reputation. Together on Smart Earth, Jung-yeon and Ho-soo try to find Joon-hyuk to warn him about how the rendezvous with Minister Park is a trap. Jung-yeon sees that pictures of her have been spread throughout Smart Earth as a wanted criminal, and Ho-soo receives a call that it\\u2019s because \\u201cBluebird\\u201d has terrorized Mayor Yoon (Minister Park has framed Bluebird for his own crime).  Hearing this, their level of urgency goes up, and Jung-yeon wants to hack into Human B\\u2019s system immediately so that they can find Joon-hyuk and escape together. However, Ho-soo knows that the moment Jung-yeon starts using her hacking skills, her IP will be tracked down instantly due to the high alerts that Human B\\u2019s implemented. So he argues against her as he tells her that Joon-hyuk charged him with her safety, and he can\\u2019t abandon that request.  Soon enough, Joon-hyuk shows up completely unharmed, and the trio determine their next course of action. They can\\u2019t go to Ordinary Earth to regroup because they wouldn\\u2019t be able to get back into Smart Earth with all those stringent security measures now in place, so Ho-soo comes up with a location where no one on Smart Earth will think to look: a church. Ho-soo explains that because their emotional insecurities have been largely stabilized by the Care Chip, the citizens of Smart Earth have no need for religion, and so no one goes to churches anymore. Sure enough, they arrive at a completely empty church, and the reprieve allows them to talk freely.  Joon-hyuk reveals that Minister Park is actually the CEO of Human B, and that he drew them into a trap. Jung-yeon realizes that if Minister Park is the CEO of Human B, his main target is her, because she\\u2019s the hacker who\\u2019s been destroying his company\\u2019s greatest achievement by reversing the controlled amnesia of all of Smart Earth\\u2019s citizens. Jung-yeon offers to give herself up, but Joon-hyuk is the one to put a stop to her as he says that her doing so won\\u2019t guarantee Woo-jin\\u2019s release. \\u201cIf it were Woo-jin, he wouldn\\u2019t send you there,\\u201d Joon-hyuk adds. \\u201cIf Human B steals you away and I meet Woo-jin again, how will I face him?\\u201d Joon-hyuk determines that they have to think faster and smarter than their enemy, and Ho-soo suggests that he knows exactly the person they can use to infiltrate Human B.  While Deputy Chief Lee seems to realize that Bluebird has no plans on leaving Smart Earth anytime soon, our trio stakes out in front of a building shortly before dawn. Is this Minister Park or Mayor Yoon\\u2019s house? Then the scene cuts back to Human B headquarters, where Minister Park yells at Deputy Chief Lee again for not having the situation resolved by now. He storms out when he gets a message that the chair of the national assembly wants to see him. Meanwhile, Secretary Shin keeps glancing at the clock, looking like she\\u2019s late for something. Noticing this, Deputy Chief Lee tells her that it\\u2019s all right, and that she\\u2019s free to go (even though it\\u2019s pretty clear that everyone is in crisis mode right now).  In his meeting with the assemblywoman, Minister Park shows off his oily personality by feigning ignorance about Mayor Yoon\\u2019s unfortunate terror attack by Bluebird, pretending as if it all didn\\u2019t happen exactly the way he wanted it to. They talk about the bill for human cloning that\\u2019s currently in parliament, and the assemblywoman mentions that she doesn\\u2019t think it will pass. Minister Park remarks that if that\\u2019s so, then it\\u2019s quite unfortunate, because it could be the beginning of an entirely new branch of scientific discoveries. He continues on to emphasize that despite mankind\\u2019s greatest efforts, the march of progress and science always prevails. As she leaves, the assemblywoman brings up the real reason for her visit: She\\u2019s been hearing rumors that Human B can control people\\u2019s memories. Minister Park laughs it off as a scientific impossibility, but inside, he\\u2019s thinking that she\\u2019s revealed her cards.  Secretary Shin shows up at the house that the trio were staking out at and is about to unlock the door when Joon-hyuk holds his gun to her head. After a brief tussle, he has her at a loss and outnumbered. He asks her where his brother is, and it\\u2019s pretty clear that she\\u2019s never heard of Woo-jin before. Then, a little girl with a blind walking stick comes out and calls out for Secretary Shin\\u2014they\\u2019re sisters (so that\\u2019s why Shin was in a rush to get home). Secretary Shin just tells the girl to go back inside, and Joon-hyuk offers Secretary Shin a deal: If she complies with them fully and tells them where Deputy Chief Lee goes in secret, then they\\u2019ll let the situation progress without letting her little sister know that there\\u2019s any cause for concern. With a gun to her head and her sister inside the house, Secretary Shin has no choice but to lead them to the location. Jung-yeon and Joon-hyuk enter the house while Ho-soo stands outside guarding Secretary Shin, who\\u2019s handcuffed to the car.  As they drive to the address Secretary Shin gave them, Jung-yeon looks directly at Joon-hyuk and thinks, \\u201cIt\\u2019s probably Woo-jin, right? It\\u2019s Woo-jin, don\\u2019t you think?\\u201d As if responding to her thoughts, Joon-hyuk thinks, \\u201cMaybe not. It might not be him. Let\\u2019s not get our hopes up.\\u201d Once inside the house Secretary Shin led them to, Jung-yeon and Joon-hyuk work their way through, finding no one on the first floor. They go down to the basement, and just as they\\u2019re about to open their first door, they hear a noise down the hallway. Very carefully, Joon-hyuk reaches toward the door and turns the handle. As the door creaks open inch by inch, their expressions change from trepidation to shock as they see what\\u2019s inside\\u2026  Cut to: Secretary Shin and Ho-soo outside, as she asks him what he\\u2019s doing when he\\u2019s supposed to be on sick leave. Ho-soo replies that he\\u2019s there because what Human B is doing is wrong before asking her why she\\u2019s with Human B despite knowing about the company\\u2019s transgressions. Secretary Shin says that it\\u2019s because memory manipulation is not the only technology that Human B has\\u2014no other company has the same resources to find a cure for her sister\\u2019s blindness. This gives Ho-soo pause as he thinks about Human B\\u2019s potential to do good for society.  We return to Joon-hyuk and Jung-yeon\\u2019s discovery as they enter the room. At first, they take in the walls plastered with notes of every kind, but then their eyes fall on the figure scribbling madly and talking gibberish: Professor Han, sporting a signature cut behind his ear. In a flashback, we see what happened ten years ago, when Professor Park first strapped Professor Han to the chair. Professor Park had promised with a sinister smile that he would finish the older man\\u2019s life work, and that if Han didn\\u2019t want to end up like Kyu-chul, he\\u2019d need to stay silent. (Whaa? Did Professor Park kill Woo-jin\\u2019s dad too?) Five years later in 2022, we see that Lee Sunbae was excited for the first Care Chip he developed with Professor Park, and though Lee Sunbae suggested animal testing first, Professor Park wanted to jump straight into human clinical trials, adding that they already had their first subject: Professor Han.  Then we cut back to the present in 2037, where Joon-hyuk and Jung-yeon have just discovered her father scribbling madly into his science journal on his quest to discover the secrets of memory. With tear-rimmed eyes, Jung-yeon calls out for her father, and he greets her as if she\\u2019s just come home from school. It seems that Professor Park\\u2019s experiments worked, but that means that Professor Han is also suffering from memory loss. Joon-hyuk pushes the frail old scientist into the wall as he demands to know his brother\\u2019s whereabouts. Professor Han faintly recalls that Woo-jin was \\u201cthe answer,\\u201d  and when Joon-hyuk presses him further for answers, he struggles to remember. Then, he says, \\u201cKim Woo-jin\\u2026 is dead.\\u201d Joon-hyuk struggles to comprehend this as he tearfully asks for confirmation, which Professor Han gives by adding, \\u201cPark Dong-geun killed Kim Woo-jin.\\u201dThe villains may be motivated as much by a misguided desire to help people as they are for personal gain, but in either case, Jung-yeon is determined not to let herself be used for their purposes. One brother helps her come to terms with her identity in the present, while the other fights against the bigger evil in the future, both driven to fight despite impossible odds.  EPISODE 8 RECAP  It\\u2019s 2008, and Professor Park walks into Kim Kyu-chul\\u2019s house, which was rented to him by his colleague, Professor Han. While the men chat, an unobtrusive camera hidden in a tiny star on the ceiling scans Professor Park and tags him as someone without authorization. Professor Park hands a small box full of blue worms to Kim Kyu-chul, asking why he wanted to see them. Kim Kyu-chul reassures him that it\\u2019s only curiosity, which seems to satisfy his younger hoobae. Kim Kyu-chul tells him that he wants to make a comeback after the trouble he caused for the sake of his children. Professor Park asks after the twins, then wonders what his senior could be working on. Kim Kyu-chul promises to tell him everything and invites him for a meal. Part 1: Beta Project  Woo-jin tries to convince a distraught Professor Han that he knows nothing about his father\\u2019s life as a neuroscientist. He begs to have his brother returned to him and promises to disappear without causing any legal problems for Professor Han. His professor just laughs, grabbing Woo-jin\\u2019s face like he wants to crush it. \\u201cDo I look sane to you?\\u201d he asks, adding that the moment he started his illegal experiments, he crossed a line that he had to keep crossing over and over again. \\u201cI killed people,\\u201d he tells Woo-jin, looking momentarily pained as he does so.  But the pained expression turns into one of desperation as Professor Han insists that Woo-jin must find his father\\u2019s research. \\u201cIf you can\\u2019t find it, I\\u2019ll never stop. This tiresome experiment will continue on and more people will have to die,\\u201d Professor Han grits out. For extra motivation, he threatens Bum-gyun\\u2019s life too, should Woo-jin not find what he wants. When Woo-jin emerges out of the deserted hospital, the dirty cop hands him his backpack and warns him against reporting what happened, since he\\u2019s not the only policeman involved in this. Woo-jin takes a call from Jung-yeon in front of the cop and says that he found nothing on Professor Han\\u2019s laptop. Dirty Cop smirks and tells him to quickly finish the assignment his professor gave him.  Woo-jin gets back to his apartment and rummages through the few items of his dad that he has with him. He comes across a business card from Kim Kyu-chul\\u2019s life as a researcher. He decides to try and log into his dad\\u2019s email account, but gets stuck at the security question when he opts to change the password. Thinking back, he remembers how his father had taught him how to ride a bicycle, and in answer to the \\u201cmost prized possession\\u201d security question, he types in \\u201cthe twins.\\u201d  When it\\u2019s accepted, Woo-jin gets angry at the father who deceived them and brought them to their current state, though he almost fondly unfurls the business card he crumpled up after his short burst and wipes away his tears. Chief Hong lets the facts of the case percolate in his mind as he sketches in his notebook. It\\u2019s then that he gets a visit from his superior, who wants him to take his hands off the serial suicide case. Furious, Chief Hong borrows a lollipop from Dirty Cop and stomps out of the station. Woo-jin scrolls through pages of emails until he comes to one with a mysterious subject and an attachment. The file is compressed and needs a password to be unzipped. After trying every word and name he can think of, Woo-jin tries calling his student, Dong-soo.  Dong-soo is unreachable by phone, but Woo-jin tracks him down to a gaming den, where the kid is playing hooky from school. When Woo-jin asks if he\\u2019s a hacker, Dong-soo becomes concerned that his tutor has stalker-ish tendencies toward a girl he\\u2019s dating, but he agrees to help him in exchange for a favor. Dong-soo sets up a program to run through all possible password combinations on Woo-jin\\u2019s laptop, then sits back as Woo-jin stews in his impatience. He tries to explain to Dong-soo how important it is for him to see what\\u2019s inside the file, and realizing his tutor\\u2019s urgency, Dong-soo decides to use a different method.  While Dong-soo works on his laptop, Woo-jin visits his grandmother\\u2019s hospice room. While she\\u2019s out on her walk, he goes through her things, but unfortunately, she comes back early and mistakes him for a thief. Woo-jin desperately grabs his grandmother and asks her if his father left any research with her, but she\\u2019s too overwrought to listen. In her struggle to pull away, she scratches his face, leaving Woo-jin shaken and hurt. Defeated, Woo-jin leaves the hospice, then gets a call from Dong-soo that he\\u2019s cracked the password. He sends the file over to Woo-jin\\u2019s phone, but when Woo-jin opens it, there are only a few images of Byul with the twins in front of their old house. Woo-jin is initially disappointed, but then he wonders about the significance of the house.  We find Bum-gyun is lying on the floor of his father\\u2019s office, already in the grips of delirium as he murmurs, \\u201cWoo-jin-ah.\\u201d Professor Park thinks of his confrontation with Professor Han and reassures himself that he had no idea that illegal experiments were going on. Patting himself on the head for being different from Professor Han, he goes up to his office to find Chief Hong waiting. As soon as Chief Hong brings the dissected blue worms out of his pocket, Professor Park\\u2019s good intentions fly out the window, and he disavows knowing anything about them.  Professor Park learns from Hong that someone related to the case is now missing and that worms had come out of two of the dead students. This knowledge drives Professor Park to seek out Lee Sunbae and grill him about Professor Han\\u2019s experiments. Lee Sunbae spills the beans, admitting that Professor Han is attempting to gather a person\\u2019s memories and turn them into video files. Professor Park scoffs at the idea, since there is no way to store human memory, let alone convert those memories into footage.  Jung-yeon goes into Professor Han\\u2019s office and finds her camera sitting on the table. As she goes through its footage, Professor Han opens the door, and Jung-yeon quickly starts the recorder and places the camera so it faces Han. Hurrying out from behind his cubicle, she says that she was worried about him, but Professor Han just bluntly asks her how much she knows. Jung-yeon plays dumb for a moment, before suddenly breaking character and spitting out Byul\\u2019s name. She asks if he\\u2019s really involved in Bum-gyun\\u2019s disappearance and the student deaths.  Growing agitated, Professor Han says, \\u201cThis was all because of you.\\u201d He calls her \\u201cByul\\u201d as he says that everything he\\u2019s done was in an attempt to get her to regain her memories, and that he means to eventually use the blue worms to retrieve Byul\\u2019s old memories. Calling the deaths of the kids a \\u201cside effect,\\u201d Professor Han stresses that if Jung-yeon could get the memories back that Kim Kyu-chul locked away, all of humanity could live in a braver, grander world.  Jung-yeon listens in distress as Professor Han talks about Byul\\u2019s ability to turn her own memories into video files and choose which memories she wanted deleted. Even though the professor doesn\\u2019t know where Byul is from, he has confirmed that she shares the same DNA as other humans and therefore hopes to replicate her ability to eradicate emotional suffering from the world. He talks about how Byul never got angry, even as tears run down Jung-yeon\\u2019s face. Professor Han grabs her, still calling her \\u201cByul,\\u201d and tells her that she\\u2019s humanity\\u2019s savior. He desperately asks her to stay still while Woo-jin looks for his dad\\u2019s research. Upon seeing the resistance on her face, he ominously adds, \\u201cIf you want Woo-jin and Bum-gyun to be safe, that is.\\u201d Jung-yeon backs away from him in horror.  Min-young speaks to someone on the phone who tells her that she has a foreign object in her brain. She tells him that she\\u2019s seen the CT scan and knows the risk, but she seems relatively unconcerned about it at the moment, since has to find someone right now. Not being able to get in touch with Woo-jin, she visits the neuroscience building and quietly enters Professor Han\\u2019s office. Before she can look through his desk, Professor Park walks in, and Min-young ducks behind a desk to hide. Professor Park finds the camera Jung-yeon had left recording on Professor Han\\u2019s desk and replays the argument. Meanwhile, Professor Han has locked Jung-yeon up in what looks like a hospital room. She yells for Professor Han, still calling him \\u201cDad,\\u201d then curls up in a ball when no one opens the door.  As Professor Park absorbs what he just saw in the video, Min-young comes out of hiding, snatches the camera, and makes a run for it. Professor Park grabs her and almost manages to take the camera back when Min-young whips out her trusty taser. She accuses him of being in on the student deaths and asks him about Bum-gyun. Connecting the dots, he realizes that Bum-gyun might be in Kim Kyu-chul\\u2019s old house and promises to help her. Min-young immediately calls up Chief Hong and tells him about what she found out. As he hangs up, Dirty Cop asks Chief Hong what the call was about, and is stunned upon hearing that Bum-gyun has been located. Dirty Cop immediately calls Professor Han, who gets a lackey to send someone over to the house. Woo-jin wanders along the streets at night wondering if their old house is somehow connected to all of this. Suddenly, he gets a call from Professor Park, who without prelude tells Woo-jin that his brother is in their old house. Woo-jin looks up, and we see that he\\u2019s standing right in front of his childhood home. He runs towards it and notices an ambulance standing in front of it.  It\\u2019s the same one that carried his brother away from Eunsung Hospital. Woo-jin rushes to the front door to find two black-clad men waiting for him. He tackles them, trying to reach the door, but the two gang up on him and beat him up. Woo-jin tries to fight back and is resilient about reaching his brother, but they beat him to the ground and kick him until he\\u2019s coughing blood. As the two men leave him lying on the front yard, he crawls up to a shovel, forces himself to stand up, and bashes one of the men on the head. Min-young, Professor Park, and Chief Hong are on the road driving to the house, even as Woo-jin takes down both men and coughs out blood on the grass. Painfully and slowly, he enters the basement where Bum-gyun had been confined, but finds it empty.  Woo-jin\\u2019s eyes fall on the locked door of his father\\u2019s office in recollection, and he uses his fingerprint to get inside. He finds things askew and sees the bottom half of a figure lying on the ground. Very slowly, he approaches his father\\u2019s office until he confirms with his own eyes that it\\u2019s Bum-gyun lying on the ground. Something breaks inside him then, and he rushes to cradle his brother\\u2019s limp form in his arms as he cries and calls his name, desperate for him to wake up. Woo-jin apologizes over and over again, crying madly, until Bum-gyun awakens enough to recognize his voice. Woo-jin cries and thanks his brother for being alive, while Bum-gyun mumbles an apology of his own. Above the reunited brothers, the camera hidden in the star on the ceiling analyzes Woo-jin and decides that this individual has authorization. The computer on Kim Kyu-chul\\u2019s desk lights up, and the monitor comes alive with a string of data.  Part 2: Brave New World  Joon-hyuk sits in the Investigation Unit room playing with his Rubik\\u2019s cube. After some deliberation, he sets down the cube and walks away, and we see that the puzzle has been solved. He speaks to Jung-yeon through a VR program and tells her that he\\u2019ll meet the CEO of Human B and stop him, regardless of whether that mysterious individual is Woo-jin or not. Jung-yeon says that she unblocked memories even when she believed Woo-jin could be the CEO, so she\\u2019s completely on board with stopping Human B no matter who it is. Joon-hyuk visits the Human B building and asks Deputy Chief Lee to pass on a message to their CEO: If the man knows that he\\u2019s Bum-gyun, then it\\u2019s time the CEO met him and Bluebird in person.  Back in Ho-soo\\u2019s pad, he shows his new ally the signature cut behind his ear and says that he was a victim just like Ho-soo twenty years ago. \\u201cI was the first victim to lose my memories,\\u201d he adds, thinking that it\\u2019s not such a stretch that Human B would do something to his brother too. Ho-soo is surprised to learn that Human B is responsible for Joon-hyuk\\u2019s brother\\u2019s disappearance. Joon-hyuk scoffs at the idea of Smart Earth being a crime-free city, and says that he\\u2019ll find out where Woo-jin is once he meets the CEO.  Deputy Chief Lee informs the shadowy figure behind Human B that Joon-hyuk wants to meet him in person. In response, the chairman looks at the picture of the two brothers on the old phone. As they make their way to their office, Ho-soo advises Joon-hyuk to stop eating flour-based products for his health, and Joon-hyuk argues that eating donuts is a Hollywood-sanctioned reward for hardworking cops like himself. Affectionately calling him \\u201cErro\\u201d again, Joon-hyuk also observes that Ho-soo\\u2019s nagging has gotten worse since his chip was disconnected before shoving his last bit of donut in Ho-soo\\u2019s mouth, ha.  When they enter the Investigation Unit room, they find Bum-gyun\\u2019s old phone sitting beside Joon-hyuk\\u2019s solved Rubik\\u2019s cube. Joon-hyuk approaches it cautiously, then picks it up and turns on the display. As soon as the image of the twins appears, he recognizes the phone as his old phone and tells Ho-soo that Woo-jin was the last person to have it. He checks the messages, and there\\u2019s only one with a time, date, and location in it. Ho-soo warns him that it could be a trap. It\\u2019s the same warning he gets when he tells Chief Hong about the meeting and shows him the picture of Woo-jin with the painting, which he reveals was taken in the CEO of Human B\\u2019s office. He asks his old mentor to wait at the terminal with officers at the ready, and to protect Jung-yeon if something goes wrong. On his way back, he gets a call from Minister Park, who asks him to meet in the mayor\\u2019s office. There, Minster Park hands over a USB with a list of visitors to the long ago Investment Briefing, where Woo-jin was last sighted. He tells Joon-hyuk that if the CEO of Human B had been present in that meeting, he would be in the visitors\\u2019 memory. Joon-hyuk asks if the minister wants him to hack into the memories of these people, but Minister Park simply says that it\\u2019s up to him.  Woo-jin gives the USB to Ho-soo with instructions to meet Chief Hong should anything go wrong before leaving to meet the CEO. In his mind, he hopes that his brother doesn\\u2019t turn out to be the man behind Human B. Back in the mayor\\u2019s office, Mayor Yoon asks Minister Park if the investor\\u2019s briefing he mentioned was the one that was held in 2022. Mayor Yoon reveals that he was a reporter back then, and that he\\u2019d incidentally heard about the top secret meeting while tailing the head of a foreign company. Minister Park says that he only found out about it after entering office and takes his leave. Mayor Yoon watches him go with a thoughtful expression on his face. Chief Hong studies the picture of Woo-jin in the CEO\\u2019s office and tells Detective Ha that something is fishy. He recognizes the painting beside Woo-jin but can\\u2019t remember where he\\u2019s seen it before.  Meanwhile, Mayor Yoon goes through files of notes from his days as a reporter, until he comes across the date of the secret investment briefing. Among the list of attendees, he finds Minster Park\\u2019s name. Mayor Yoon now recalls that though he\\u2019d not been allowed to go inside the hotel, he\\u2019d taken pictures of every person who arrived for the meet, and he\\u2019d photographed Minister Park going into the building. He immediately calls security and has Minister Park brought back to his office. He confronts the minister about hiding the truth of his presence from Joon-hyuk. Though Minister Park denies any involvement with the briefing, he doesn\\u2019t seem terribly surprised when Mayor Yoon pulls up the pictures he\\u2019d taken of him on the day of the briefing. Mayor Yoon asks him what his connection is to Human B, and Minister Park smiles strangely as he wonders how to explain it to him. As Joon-hyuk heads over to meet the CEO, Chief Hong jumps up from his seat with recognition written all over his face. At the same time, Ho-soo hands the USB to Jung-yeon.  Minister Park rounds on the mayor and asks him why he thinks Joon-hyuk was kidnapped and almost forcibly chipped. Mayor Yoon guesses that it was to keep him quiet, but the minister says that it was to block his memories. He smiles evilly at Yoon and points out that although you can\\u2019t erase the memories of someone without a chip, it\\u2019s utterly easy to do it to anyone who already has a chip in him. \\u201cMayor Yoon, do you know which emotion is the most dangerous?\\u201d Minister Park asks with a smile. \\u201cCuriosity.\\u201d As Mayor Yoon\\u2019s eyes widen in recognition of the threat, Park introduces himself as the CEO of Human B. The mayor yells that this is illegal, but Park simply repeats that he\\u2019s the CEO \\u2014 the very same person who created the chip in Mayor Yoon\\u2019s head. In flashback, we see that it was Minister Park\\u2019s plan all along to get closer to Joon-hyuk by playing the rescuer to his damsel. He had been in collusion with Deputy Chief Lee the entire time.  Then, Minister Park brings out his phone and gives the order to \\u201cerase it.\\u201d On the other end, Deputy Chief Lee types in a command into the system and blocks all of the mayor\\u2019s memories. Back in the office, Mayor Yoon suddenly collapses. After taking a moment to look over the mayor\\u2019s prone form, he calls in security and directs them to get help while pretending to be distraught.  Chief Hong unearths an old notebook from 2017 while Joon-hyuk reaches the meeting site. Jung-yeon goes through the content of the USB and tells Ho-soo that it\\u2019s not a list of names but of chip addresses, and that they can access their memory footage if she tracks each one. Minister Park calls a council meeting of Smart Citizens and brings Deputy Chief Lee in to explain what happened to Mayor Yoon. Lee lies that Bluebird hacked into the mayor\\u2019s memory and blocked all of it so that he will never function normally again. Understandably, everyone present becomes instantly aware of how vulnerable they are, and Minister Park takes advantage of this and declares that Smart Earth is under attack.  Citing a Smart Earth law, Minister Park takes over the governance of the city in his capacity as the Minister of Science and Economy. As he begins a manhunt for Bluebird, the only one to look concerned is Mayor Yoon\\u2019s personal assistant. On Ordinary Earth, Chief Hong flips open his old notebook to a page of scribbles. It\\u2019s a sketch he made of the painting that now hangs in the CEO\\u2019s office. Back in 2017, he\\u2019d first seen it above Professor Park\\u2019s desk and sketched it while waiting for him. Putting the pieces together, Chief Hong realizes that Minister Park must be the CEO of Human B. As Jung-yeon traces the address in the USB, she realizes that something is wrong. The USB was just a way for the Human B supercomputer to hack into her system and detect her location. Even as her base is being located, Jung-yeon immediately disconnects everything and runs out with Ho-soo.  Anticipating her escape, Minister Park directs Deputy Chief Lee to block all communication networks in that area. Now Ho-soo and Jung-yeon are cut off from Joon-hyuk, with no way to warn him of the trap. Deputy Chief Lee reports to Minister Park that they lost Bluebird, but Minister Park has one more card up his sleeve. He reaches the place where Joon-hyuk is waiting, huffing and out of breath, and tells him that Bluebird has been compromised. Joon-hyuk says that there is a place he is supposed meet Jung-yeon in this kind of a situation, and they head over together. Their car stops in the middle of a field, and Park follows Joon-hyuk out with a minion in tow. That\\u2019s when Joon-hyuk casually turns around and asks what\\u2019s really going on. Pulling out his phone, he shows Minister Park the picture of Woo-jin and the painting. We see that before the communication blackout, Chief Hong was able to call Joon-hyuk and tell him where he\\u2019d seen that painting before.  Now, Joon-hyuk asks why Minister Park\\u2019s painting would be hanging in Human B\\u2019s CEO\\u2019s office. Minister Park tries to pretend that it\\u2019s a copy, but as soon as Joon-hyuk takes a step closer, Minister Park\\u2019s minion pulls out a gun. Joon-hyuk easily disarms the man and swipes the gun, pointing and shooting past the minister\\u2019s ear in the same motion. As Minister Park\\u2019s ears ring, Joon-hyuk studies the man\\u2019s neck and notes that no chip lights up to combat the rush of adrenaline normal in this situation. He asks Minister Park if he\\u2019s the CEO of Human B.  Instead of answering, Minister Park asks where Jung-yeon is. Joon-hyuk asks him again, and this time, Minister Park admits that he\\u2019s the man Joon-hyuk had wanted to meet so badly. \\u201cHow do you feel?\\u201d the minister asks with a smirk. We see that day in Professor Han\\u2019s office one more time, when Minister Park first learned about Byul\\u2019s ability to store and erase memories. This time, we see how his hands trembled and his eyes lit up at the possibilities such an ability could open up. In the present, Joon-hyuk holds a gun to CEO Park\\u2019s head and yells, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s Woo-jin? Where\\u2019s my little brother?\\u201dJust when I thought that I knew what was happening, Circle does a 180 degree reverse on me and starts making me think the complete opposite. The show is definitely turning out to be a mind-bender, but I love that about it because it lets us explore the other side, rather than sticking to a confined mindset. In this episode in particular, Woo-jin and Joon-hyuk are both forced to speculate the motivations of their missing family in their respective timelines, and it leads to their own growth as they realize that perhaps what they accepted as givens may not have been true.  EPISODE 7 RECAP  Byul focuses intently on something on the computer screen, while scribbling furiously away on the electronic notepad. The little twin brothers Bum-gyun and Woo-jin play a morse code game from separate rooms, decoding each other\\u2019s words. But soon Bum-gyun stands up in victory, having received no response challenge from the communicator. On his way to find his brother, who is always with Byul nowadays, he sees his grandmother hanging up laundry and proceeds walking through a dark basement passageway and a sophisticated security system to his father\\u2019s office, which he unlocks with his fingerprint. He gloats gleefully that he beat Woo-jin, who insists that he stopped playing because it wasn\\u2019t fun anymore. But then, Bum-gyun sees Byul at their father\\u2019s computer, and sighs because she\\u2019s writing nonsense again, and he\\u2019s worried that she might mess up their father\\u2019s stuff.  Byul and the children quit the room when their dad, Kim Kyu-chul, comes back to do some work. However, when he sees what Byul has been working on, his eyes grow wide with amazement. He takes a cross-shaped USB stick and promptly saves the material. Part 1: Beta Project Seeing Professor Han\\u2019s old photograph, Woo-jin is stunned to realize that his father is the man standing in the corner. Looking at his crestfallen expression, Jung-yeon cautiously asks him whether he remembers anything about his father. He defensively fires back whether she recalls any of her own past.  Meanwhile, the old Eunsung Hospital psych patient tells Chief Hong that it was Kim Kyu-chul who was the head of the illegal research program performed there. The detective immediately goes to confront Woo-jin and Jung-yeon about it, and demands to know what they\\u2019re trying to do, because it can\\u2019t be coincidence that they\\u2019re both children of the main researchers from Eunsung Hospital. He says that Eunsung ran unethical human experiments ten years ago, and the lead researcher was Woo-jin\\u2019s father. Woo-jin reels in shock and frustration at these new revelations, saying that he\\u2019s the one who is most curious to know what all of this means. He insists that his father was an ordinary salaryman, not some disgraced scientist from MIT, as Chief Hong claims.  Meanwhile, in the dark basement where Bum-gyun is being held captive, he shucks off his cast and stumbles around to get his bearings. Suffering from an intense headache and a flowing nosebleed, he limps around blindly until he eventually gets the lights to turn on. Then one by one, things start to look familiar. He stops at the grandfather clock and we see little Bum-gyun walk past it in his memory. He vaguely begins to recognize his surroundings as his childhood home, and he turns toward the door that once led to his father\\u2019s office. He tries his fingerprint, and it still works to unlock the door. He enters the office to find a room full of furniture all covered with sheets. As he pulls the sheets away, his memories of the space come flooding back. He pauses in front of a wall and then pulls down one last sheet, revealing a family portrait of Dad and the twins. Bum-gyun gets emotional at the sight of Dad and Woo-jin, but then the fear and panic set in, as he wonders why he\\u2019s been brought here.  Sunbae Lee sneaks around to the basement where Bum-gyun is trapped, and he doesn\\u2019t notice that Professor Park has followed him there. Moreover, Professor Park recognizes the house as Kyu-chul sunbae\\u2019s, and wonders what is going on. Sunbae Lee is confused when Bum-gyun is nowhere to be found, when suddenly Bum-gyun surprises him with a sneak attack from behind. Bum-gyun punches him over and over and pins him up against the wall in a stranglehold, screaming, \\u201cDie! Die!\\u201d in a blind rage. But then another headache comes on, and Sunbae Lee sees his opening to slam Bum-gyun against the wall so hard that he\\u2019s knocked unconscious. The sunbae scrambles away, badly shaken up by the fight, and locks the basement door behind him. He reports to Professor Han that the CCTV has been installed, and then he asks nervously if this is really okay. Professor Han tells him to endure just a little longer, because they\\u2019re almost there. From the bushes, Professor Park listens in on Sunbae Lee\\u2019s side of the call and gathers that Professor Han is behind this.  Back at the lab, Professor Han recollects a conversation with Bum-gyun, when he was still being held captive at the hospital. Professor Han begged him desperately to find out where his father hid their experiment data, but it was clear that Bum-gyun didn\\u2019t know, because he just railed back at him, demanding to know where his father was. As he\\u2019s reflecting, Professor Park comes into the lab to confront him about what he found out after following Sunbae Lee to Kim Kyu-chul\\u2019s old house. Professor Park can\\u2019t believe that Professor Han has been carrying out more research on students to continue the work of their banned experiment. He raises his concerns, saying that his invention\\u2014the blue bot\\u2014has not been safety-approved for human experimentation.  Yet, Professor Han just accuses Professor Park of having an inkling all along and by the virtue of not stopping him, he\\u2019s become a complicit party, an automatic co-conspirator. Professor Han threatens Professor Park into staying silent on the subject by saying that they\\u2019re already on the same boat; if one goes down, then so will the other. Jung-yeon hesitates at the door to her own home, not wanting to go in and face the lies that her supposed \\u201cfather\\u201d has been feeding her all this time. She heads back out instead. Woo-jin frantically digs through his things again to see if there\\u2019s anything he\\u2019s missed. Concluding that there isn\\u2019t, he makes up his mind to follow the only lead he has, and he takes off from his apartment before dawn. But on his way out, he notices Jung-yeon hunched over at the base of the steps in his hallway.  Despite his frantic need to find out what\\u2019s happening, he takes a slow moment to gently wake her. She doesn\\u2019t respond at first, so he leans in, which is when she pops her head up, putting their faces inches apart. It stuns them both, and after a beat, he stands up awkwardly. He chides her for not calling, but she just asks where he\\u2019s going so early. He says that his grandmother might be the only one who knows what happened to his father, so he\\u2019s heading to the nursing home.  Before they enter the facility, Woo-jin tells Jung-yeon that his grandmother doesn\\u2019t recognize him anymore because she has a form of dementia, and she doesn\\u2019t remember anything after her son\\u2019s disappearance. When they visit his grandmother together, Grandma backs up in alarm when she sees Woo-jin, not believing that he is her grandson, who should be 11 years old. However, she immediately recognizes Jung-yeon as Byul, the girl who lives with her son\\u2019s family, and greets her warmly. Jung-yeon takes that as her cue to ask about Woo-jin\\u2019s father and his belongings, but Grandma doesn\\u2019t know anything. She just tells them to ask her son when he gets home, and Woo-jin quietly wipes his tears and gets up to go. As they depart, Jung-yeon admits that the more they uncover, the more afraid she becomes of unlocking her memories. She doesn\\u2019t know what to do next, so Woo-jin says that with his father missing, all they have is her father to go on. He plans to get into Professor Han\\u2019s computer somehow.  Jung-yeon tells Woo-jin that she has one more secret he doesn\\u2019t know, and at first he\\u2019s alarmed, but then she announces proudly that she\\u2019s a hacker. She says that she even entered a hacker competition and \\u201cwon\\u2026 something close to first place.\\u201d He pointedly says that means she didn\\u2019t win, but she argues that the important part is that she\\u2019s already used her \\u201cskills\\u201d to obtain access to her father\\u2019s computer. From the nursing home facility window, Woo-jin\\u2019s grandmother watches them leave with an inscrutable expression on her face. Then we see that the wooden cross containing Dad\\u2019s USB stick is hanging from her neck. Jung-yeon distracts her father by suggesting lunch, and when he seems hesitant to go, she implies that her memory is returning and it works like a charm. Once they\\u2019re gone, Woo-jin sneaks into the lab and discovers that the \\u201chacking skill\\u201d Jung-yeon boasted about is just a rudimentary hidden camera.  He replays the video of Professor Han typing in his password and proceeds to unlock the laptop. He\\u2019s horrified when he finds videos of his brother lying on a table and convulsing violently in pain. Through tears he can\\u2019t stop from falling, Woo-jin quickly remembers his purpose and takes out an external hard drive to copy all the data. Meanwhile, Min-young who had been at the police station earlier to ask about their progress into Bum-gyun\\u2019s case, sits down with Chief Hong and tells him that the blood bank workers were all wearing masks, but the driver had something in his mouth, maybe a cigarette or something like it. Woo-jin calls the police station to let them know that he\\u2019s found hard evidence against the culprit, and his call is intercepted by another detective, one of Chief Hong\\u2019s subordinates\\u2026 the guy who\\u2019s always sucking on a lollipop.  The cop, after hearing that Woo-jin has procured evidence, immediately rushes to Handam University to pick him up. Woo-jin jumps into the policeman\\u2019s car without a second thought, but when they start going away from the city, the cop starts becoming evasive, and Woo-jin gets uneasy vibes. So he grabs the steering wheel in an attempt to force a stop, sending the car swerving back and forth in the road. The cop slams on the brakes and whips out a gun, pointing it directly at Woo-jin\\u2019s skull. The entire way to Eunsung Hospital, the cop keeps the gun aimed at Woo-jin for him to comply, and on the other side of the final door he\\u2019s forced to go through, Professor Han is there waiting. The cop hands over Woo-jin\\u2019s external hard drive where he stored all of the evidence, and Professor Han goes on a violent rampage to physically destroy the data.  Emotions are on high for both Woo-jin and Professor Han, as the professor explains that his research is the next great step in human advancement. He clearly believes that Woo-jin\\u2019s father stole research that was rightfully his when he disappeared with Byul\\u2019s extrapolations, which provided the key bridge in their research to control the basis of human memory. Woo-jin screams that that\\u2019s not science, but crime. But Professor Han argues that Woo-jin is a scientist too, and he gets this manic glint in his eyes as he describes how they will be able to rid people of their unpleasant memories, save them from unhappiness, and maybe even rid the world of crime completely. Grasping Woo-jin\\u2019s shoulders, Professor Han implores him to help him find his father so that he can recover his lost research, becoming increasingly unhinged and desperate. He adds that with these advancements, Bum-gyun could live happily without his traumatic memories. Woo-jin stares back at him, shaken.  Part 2: Brave New World Minister Park is taken aback when he realizes that Jung-yeon is Bluebird, and Joon-hyuk can\\u2019t believe it when she tells them that Woo-jin could possibly be the CEO of Human B. The evidence she does have is flimsy though, only based on the fact that the last photo she could find of Woo-jin was taken in the office of Human B\\u2019s CEO.  Minister Park opens Joon-hyuk up to the possibility that the CEO could be Woo-jin because he was the only one with access to Professor Han\\u2019s research before he disappeared. Joon-hyuk refuses to believe it, claiming that his own memories are the proof: He admits that his memories haven\\u2019t returned, and what he \\u201cremembers\\u201d is what he\\u2019s cobbled together from watching the footage of Woo-jin\\u2019s memories. Minister Park asks if he also remembers Woo-jin saying that oblivion was the only sure treatment for PTSD, and says that they must consider all possibilities even if they don\\u2019t want to believe it. Jung-yeon passes through Smart Earth\\u2019s security system to Ordinary Earth using a decoy chip, and soon Joon-hyuk tracks her down and pulls her aside into an alleyway to question her about Woo-jin.  He demands to know how of all people Jung-yeon could think that Woo-jin would become this evil mastermind who takes people\\u2019s memories without permission. Jung-yeon tells him truthfully that Woo-jin could come to think that way because of his brother. She says that when they finally found Bum-gyun, he had lost his memories, and Woo-jin had a hard time accepting it. Joon-hyuk says it must\\u2019ve been hard for Woo-jin not to be recognized by his own brother, but Jung-yeon clarifies that Bum-gyun looked happy. Bum-gyun had smiled with an innocence unshadowed by memories of their father\\u2019s abandonment, and she says that smile prompted Woo-jin to think that perhaps he was better off not having painful memories. She suspects that this experience could have become the beginning of Human B\\u2019s creation, and hearing this, Joon-hyuk breaks down in tears. He looks sad and lost as he asks, \\u201cIt\\u2019s\\u2026 all because of me?\\u201d He sounds so fragile as he dares to wonder if he spent ten years in search of Woo-jin, while Woo-jin didn\\u2019t want to be found. Jung-yeon pulls off a pendant that Woo-jin gave her at their last meeting before he rushed off to see Professor Han, and asks Joon-hyuk how he thinks she feels. Woo-jin promised he would come back for her, but she never saw him again, and now all she knows is that he might be the CEO of Human B. \\u201cI thought he couldn\\u2019t come back! But what if he didn\\u2019t want to come back?\\u201d she asks, tears streaming down her face.  In a holographic meeting, Minister Park tells Mayor Yoon that he wants to publicly announce Human B\\u2019s misdeeds now that they\\u2019ve gone too far, trying to forcibly implant a Care Chip into a non-consenting Ordinary Earth citizen. Mayor Yoon doesn\\u2019t want him to do so because it might hurt his own political capital with his citizens, so he promises the minister that he\\u2019ll take care of the Human B problem. Mayor Yoon saves Deputy Chief Lee from his interrogation in Ordinary Earth (although he didn\\u2019t seem to need much saving, having been pretty unrepentant and silent), on the condition that Mayor Yoon will gain a direct hotline to Human B\\u2019s CEO. Chief Hong is outraged that Mayor Yoon would suddenly pull out their biggest lead in the investigation. But because Deputy Chief Lee is a Smart Earth citizen, and technically under Mayor Yoon\\u2019s jurisdiction, he can only watch helplessly as the Human B manager leaves freely.  Something is clearly up with Joon-hyuk. He\\u2019s suddenly in a cheery mood and insists on taking a trip, and drags Min-young to a virtual reality center so that they can take a leisure day. This is so jarringly out of character, and Min-young knows that something is wrong, but Joon-hyuk keeps up a playful facade, seeming to want to leave all his responsibilities behind for the day. He sneaks alcohol into the center despite it being against the rules, and as they drink illegal beers together, he brings up his real concern\\u2014that Woo-jin might not want to be found. Min-young tries to ask more, but stops when she senses that he doesn\\u2019t want to explain.  At the police station, Chief Hong is forced to let Park Jin-gyu go as well, despite knowing that he was a co-perpetrator in Min-ji\\u2019s kidnapping all those years ago. He tells the man, who seems genuinely sorry for his actions, that as punishment he should live with the guilt of those memories for the rest of his life. Chief Hong comes to the virtual reality center after receiving a call from Min-young that Joon-hyuk is acting strange. When he sees Joon-hyuk aimlessly playing games, he tries to shake him from his funk, but nothing rouses Joon-hyuk until an emergency call from Smart Earth arrives, showing a clip of Min-ji threatening Park Jin-gyu\\u2019s life.  When they arrive at the apartment, they hear Park Jin-gyu\\u2019s pained screams through the door. They bust in and see that he is unharmed, but Min-ji is slumped over on a chair, unconscious with a pool of blood draining from her slit wrist. The cops quickly take her to the hospital, while Chief Hong reels in shock that the girl he rescued is in danger of dying again. Min-ji survives, and when she wakes up at the hospital, Joon-hyuk asks why she did this. She replies that she found it appallingly unjust that none of the men who kidnapped her remembered what they did. She couldn\\u2019t reconcile the fact that her kidnappers had been living happy lives afterwards, as if nothing had happened, as if they hadn\\u2019t committed that crime.  As she\\u2019s explaining her feelings about recovering her memories, Ho-soo is going through the same stages of grief and anger she\\u2019s describing. Ho-soo remembers that when he tried to be intimate with his girlfriend, she was fearful of his presence and pushed him away, haunted by a trauma in her past. And then he remembers seeing her dangling feet after she committed suicide. In the present, Ho-soo puts on the tie his girlfriend gave him, and goes to confront his girlfriend\\u2019s father, whom he knows was the sexual predator who had driven her to suicide. He demands to know whether the father remembers what he did to his daughter.  But the father has no memory of her existence at all. Ho-soo grabs him by the collar and cries that his daughter died because of what he did to her, but he thinks Ho-soo is just a crazed loon. Ho-soo sends a flying punch in his direction, but as he\\u2019s about to punch him again, the man\\u2019s younger daughter comes out to defend him and they run away. In the hospital, Min-ji asks Joon-hyuk whether what she did was so wrong. As he leaves the hospital room, Joon-hyuk questions his current mission to find Woo-jin at all costs. He thinks that perhaps Woo-jin could be living a happier life without the traumatic memory of searching for Bum-gyun at such a young age. Chief Hong thinks that he should continue to search for Woo-jin because that\\u2019s what family does for each other, but Joon-hyuk is still conflicted, wondering if he isn\\u2019t bothering someone who would rather not remember him. He wonders if maybe living in the dark is better after all, because there\\u2019s nothing more frightening than memories.  That\\u2019s when Ho-soo shows up and tells him he\\u2019s had a change of heart. He now thinks that what Joon-hyuk originally believed was correct: Memories, no matter how horrible, are necessary for people to acknowledge the truth and take responsibility for their own actions. People who wronged others shouldn\\u2019t get to forget and live happily without those memories, he argues. Deep in thought, Joon-hyuk solves his Rubik\\u2019s Cube mindlessly, and at the end of his deliberation, he heads purposefully to the Human B headquarters. He meets Deputy Chief Lee at the entrance, and proposes a three-way meeting between himself, the Human B CEO, and Bluebird. Moments later, someone sets an old phone down next to Joon-hyuk\\u2019s Rubik\\u2019s Cube, showing a message with the time and address of the proposed meeting. The phone\\u2019s screensaver returns, showing the picture of Woo-jin and Bum-gyun that Bum-gyun used to have on his phone.Memories are at the crux of this drama, both in a literal and figurative sense, and especially so for a couple of key characters this episode. For Jung-yeon, it\\u2019s a source of identity crisis and a question of whom to trust, while in 2037, it\\u2019s an unwanted burden that pushes Ho-soo to the edge in his desperation to be rid of them. But at what cost? Is someone\\u2019s right to remember more important than someone else\\u2019s right to forget? EPISODE 6 RECAP  Little Woo-jin and Bum-gyun enter their home one Sunday to find their dad hurrying out to work. They wander into another room, where Byul stands with her back to them. When asked what she\\u2019s doing, she hands Woo-jin the Bluebird storybook. Woo-jin thinks she wants him to read it again, and Bum-gyun gets annoyed that a full-grown adult can\\u2019t speak or read. Woo-jin defends her, saying that she doesn\\u2019t know Earth\\u2019s languages yet, when suddenly Byul says: \\u201cBluebird.\\u201d As the boys look at her in surprise, she points to the book and repeats the words, as if testing out how it sounds. Part 1: Beta Project  Jung-yeon smashes the star and finds a rolled-up note with \\u201cByul \\u2665 Woo-jin\\u201d written on it. Stunned, she falls back into the seat and looks at her reflection. Tears streak down her face as she asks: \\u201cWhat\\u2026 am I?\\u201d Woo-jin chases after the ambulance with all his might, but gets left behind on the road. Returning to the hospital, he tells Chief Hong about the ambulance, and Hong immediately calls in the license plate number. But then Min-young, who\\u2019d recognized the bluebird logo on the vehicle, makes the connection and realizes that it wasn\\u2019t an ambulance but a blood donation van. She takes out her phone and shows Woo-jin the selfies she\\u2019d taken after donating blood in front of that same van. Woo-jin recognizes one of the students entering the van in the background\\u2014she was the first to die by jumping off the roof. Min-young confirms that the girl had nosebleeds and headaches before her death\\u2026 much like Min-young herself.  Woo-jin realizes then that the bluebird his brother had referred to was the van. But then, Chief Hong gets a report from his station about the vehicle: It was scrapped earlier that year, so it no longer exists in the system. Meanwhile, Jung-yeon is still reeling from the Byul discovery and sits curled up in a ball, looking frightened. Her phone lights up with a call from \\u201cDad,\\u201d and she doesn\\u2019t look inclined to pick up. Chief Hong asks if they have any more information for him, and says that the pen in Professor Han\\u2019s possession isn\\u2019t enough to start an investigation on. Min-young begins to tell him about Jung-yeon, but is silenced by Woo-jin.  Once they\\u2019re alone, Min-young yells at him for stopping her from revealing the Professor\\u2019s alien connection. Woo-jin points out that if they started talking about those things, they would lose Chief Hong\\u2019s trust. Min-young huffs in frustration that they missed Bum-gyun by a few minutes. Woo-jin sighs that she\\u2019s better than him, since he didn\\u2019t believe his own brother until he saw things with his own eyes. He assures her that they\\u2019ll find Bum-gyun since they now have a clue. He smiles a little and says that he shares a telepathic connection with his brother since they\\u2019re twins. He bids her goodnight, then spends all night wandering the streets looking for Bum-gyun.  Woo-jin ends up at Eunsung Mental Hospital again in the morning, and pushes past the police tape into the room where Bum-gyun was confined. And this time, he notices a CCTV in one corner, blinking red. At the police station, Chief Hong\\u2019s skeptical partner tells him that none of the CCTVs inside the hospital are working, and none of the cameras on the streets caught sight of the van last night. Hong orders him to look into the person who modified the blood donation van, since that is their only lead right now. Woo-jin visits the police station, and Chief Hong tells him that Eunsung never employed Professor Han. Woo-jin asks for the hospital\\u2019s employee roster, saying that he\\u2019ll go meet each person individually. Chief Hong notes Woo-jin\\u2019s exhausted face and clothes from last night and asks if he\\u2019s eaten yet. Promising to meet the employees himself, he tells Woo-jin to go rest.  Woo-jin finally goes back to his apartment and finds Jung-yeon waiting for him in the hallway. Jung-yeon hands him the note she found inside the star and says in a scared little voice, \\u201cI think I\\u2019m Byul.\\u201d She apologizes, but Woo-jin says flatly that she shouldn\\u2019t be sorry since she didn\\u2019t know anything. She says she\\u2019s sorry for not knowing, and he replies that she\\u2019s just here to make excuses for being innocent. He turns to go in, and Jung-yeon stops him, asking plaintively, \\u201cWhat do I do now?\\u201d She realizes that he was right about her being an alien, but doesn\\u2019t know what to do next.  Woo-jin\\u2019s eyes fill with angry tears as he flings the same words back at her. He asks what he should do now that the girl he wanted to trust turns out to be an alien, and his brother, whom he didn\\u2019t want to believe, is missing because of him. After that outburst, Woo-jin calms down and lets her come in. She tells that \\u201cbluebird\\u201d was the first word she spoke when she awoke from her coma three years ago. In flashback, we see Professor Han asking rather eagerly if she really doesn\\u2019t remember anything, then telling her that she\\u2019s his daughter Han Jung-yeon. In the present, Jung-yeon asks what happened to Byul and how she (Jung-yeon) ended up without her memories. Woo-jin says that his dad had left for a trip overseas, telling them that he would drop her off at a facility on his way. That was the last time he saw either of them. He shows her a picture of his dad, but Jung-yeon doesn\\u2019t recognize him.  They sit quietly together for a long time, until Woo-jin brings up Professor Han. He says that her \\u201cdad\\u201d has all the answers they\\u2019re looking for and asks for her help in investigating the man. Jung-yeon realizes that after all that, Woo-jin still trusts her, and tearfully thanks him for it. Bum-gyun wakes up in the basement of a building with a barred door. He remembers Woo-jin running after the van, then gets sudden pain in his head, accompanied by a nosebleed. Oh no, this is too soon! Then he notices the CCTV cameras in the room and angrily throws objects at them.  Professor Han watches this footage on his laptop, sitting in his office, and sees the camera finally fall from one of Bum-gyun\\u2019s shots. He hisses in frustration, then shuts the laptop as soon as Professor Park and Sunbae Lee walk in. Han gives Sunbae Lee an address and his car keys and asks him to pick up something he\\u2019d left there. Professor Park gets suspicious and gets into the car with Lee, asking to be dropped off on the way. Suddenly \\u201crecalling\\u201d that he left his bag back in the office, he sends Sunbae Lee to fetch it, and takes advantage of his absence to copy down the address he\\u2019d just keyed into the GPS system. Noting the area, Park gets a speculative look on his face and wonders what Professor Han is up to.  One of Eunsung Hospital\\u2019s employees tells Chief Hong that she doesn\\u2019t recognize Professor Han as having worked there. She mentions some odd rumors floating around the hospital before it closed, though she emphasizes that they were groundless. Chief Hong asks to hear them anyway, and is told of patients claiming to be subject to experiments, seeing ghosts, and even a death in the basement. Chief Hong meets with one of the patients who spoke about being experimented upon and shows him Han\\u2019s picture, asking if this was the man who conducted the experiments. But the man is unresponsive and just sits there blankly, and the nurse tells him that the patient hasn\\u2019t spoken in a year. Chief Hong sees that he\\u2019s not likely to get a response, and turns to leave the room\\u2026 just as the patient says, \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t him.\\u201d Chief Hong turns back intently, eager to hear more.  While the professor is out, Jung-yeon tries a ring of keys on his locked office until one of them opens the door, letting them inside to search. They don\\u2019t know exactly what they\\u2019re looking for, but they hurry inside to rifle through the desk and bookshelves for clues. But Professor Han arrives home soon after, and they don\\u2019t seem to hear him. He\\u2019s speaking to Jung-yeon\\u2019s therapist on the phone, who sighs that they must recover Jung-yeon\\u2019s lost memories quickly, because Byul knows the secret to the Stable Care System. Han clarifies that what they need to find are the memories that were suppressed, and his associate emphasizes the need to hurry, because the experiment comes with serious side effects. He grumbles, \\u201cIf only that jerk hadn\\u2019t done that to Byul, we wouldn\\u2019t be in this situation.\\u201d  Suddenly, he hears a noise from his office. Woo-jin and Jung-yeon freeze as a book from the shelf falls to the ground. When Woo-jin picks it up, something slips out from the pages. It\\u2019s a plastic-wrapped picture of Professor Han at the entrance of Eunsung Hospital. Just then, Professor Han enters the office and Woo-jin quickly hides the picture. When asked what they\\u2019re doing here, Jung-yeon nervously makes the excuse that she\\u2019d brought Woo-jin to look at the books in his office and apologizes for coming in without permission. She and Woo-jin sweat under her father\\u2019s scrutiny, and he looks at Woo-jin through narrowed eyes. But then he offers to pick out books for Woo-jin, and they relax to have him buy their story.  The two get back to Woo-jin\\u2019s apartment, and he shows Jung-yeon the picture. Taking it out of the plastic, he says that it\\u2019s decisive evidence that Han was involved with the hospital. There are other pictures behind the first one though, and they look through them until suddenly, Woo-jin pauses at one. Meanwhile at the hospital, Chief Hong presses the patient for the identity of the man who conducted experiments, asking if it was Professor Han. He\\u2019s stunned when the man corrects him with a different name: \\u201cKim Kyu-chul!\\u201d Woo-jin stares at the photo, wondering, \\u201cDad?\\u2026 That\\u2019s my dad!\\u201d In the picture along with Professor Han is his very own father. Woo-jin looks up at Jung-yeon in shock and confusion: \\u201cWhy is my dad here?\\u201d  Part 2: Brave New World The penthouse sanctum of Human B\\u2019s chairman is breached, and as the security staff scans each room for an intruder, Jung-yeon walks easily into his office, dressed as one of the staff. She plants a bug on his personal computer, and on her way out, she pauses as her eyes fall on something.  Back at her lair, her eyes widen as she goes through some data and comes across the picture of Woo-jin in 2022. This was a month ago. Now, Jung-yeon walks into Joon-hyuk\\u2019s office and says that Woo-jin is in Smart Earth. He asks her if the chairman has Woo-jin and who the chairman could be. It makes Jung-yeon think of the chairman in his penthouse, and she seems to think one thing and then decide to say something else\\u2014merely that she\\u2019s looking into it.  Then Jung-yeon gets a notification on her phone and taps an icon to get first person view from Ho-soo\\u2019s eyes. Ah, she\\u2019s hacked into the system (to his chip?) to keep tabs on him. So, by the time Ho-soo runs back to the Investigation Unit with Secretary Shin at his heels, Jung-yeon and Joon-hyuk have disappeared. Ho-soo instantly realizes that Bluebird has been monitoring his movement. He puts his hand on the table, and the surface changes to become a screen with a monitor that shows his own face. Speaking directly to Jung-yeon, he tells her that she has no right to criticize Human B when she fools around with people\\u2019s memories herself.  He gets a splitting headache and has to run to the washroom. Ho-soo tries to take a pill for it but drops it in the sink with shaking hands. He throws the box of pills in anger, and his chips lights up to calm him. It can\\u2019t make the headache go away though, and Ho-soo bend over in pain. Suddenly, a memory surfaces and he envisions himself running into a room, calling out his girlfriend\\u2019s name in panic. Then he stops and his face twists in grief as he registers her body hanging from the ceiling. As he breaks down in the past, his present self weeps with remembered pain.  Secretary Shin reports that Bluebird was monitoring Ho-soo\\u2019s memory. That means Joon-hyuk knows that Ho-soo\\u2019s reporting to them, thus making Ho-soo a liability. Ho-soo barges into the office and asks one more time for his memories to be blocked. His voice raises as he calls this his right as a Smart Earth citizen, and his desperation is palpable. So Deputy Chief Lee is forced to admit one additional detail: that they actually can\\u2019t block his memories at the moment, because Bluebird locked the process when she unblocked the memories, and they\\u2019ve been unable to crack the code.  At this, Ho-soo despairs, \\u201cHow long will I have to live like this?\\u201d Lee tells him that the fastest solution is to find Bluebird. Ho-soo takes a deep breath and asks for his Care Chip to be completely disconnected from the system, since that\\u2019s the only way to keep Bluebird from monitoring his memories. Deputy Chief Lee warns that disabling the chip will isolate Ho-soo from Human B and they won\\u2019t be able to protect him any more. Ho-soo says bitterly that the most dangerous thing has already happened to him. After he leaves, Secretary Shin worries whether they\\u2019ll be okay to let him do this, pointing out that Ho-soo had undergone psychiatric treatment for his trauma before the memories were removed. Lee just says that that will make him more desperate to ensure they\\u2019ll be blocked again.  At an undisclosed location, Joon-hyuk asks Jung-yeon why it\\u2019s her, here now, and not Woo-jin. She asks if hej.. got his memories back, since the last time she\\u2019d seen him, he had no recollection of who he was. Joon-hyuk says that he has no memories of his own, and learned everything about himself by going through Woo-jin\\u2019s memory footage. He adds that he noticed how Woo-jin had always looked at Jung-yeon. So why is she alone now, instead of being with him? Jung-yeon just stares at him as tears rolls down her cheeks.  Detective Ha grills Chief Hong on Joon-hyuk\\u2019s relationship with Bluebird, complaining that he\\u2019s the only one in the dark. Noting that he\\u2019s also got something with Min-young, he grumbles that Joon-hyuk\\u2019s been busy romancing alongside working. Chief Hong gets a call from his superior who asks why Minister Park is running background checks on Joon-hyuk. Meanwhile, Joon-hyuk tells Jung-yeon about this minister, whom they had once known as Professor Park. He explains that Mayor Yoon has asked for his help, but Jung-yeon is distrustful of the man, since he was the last person Woo-jin spoke to before his disappearance. Joon-hyuk remembers that in Woo-jin\\u2019s memory, Professor Park had helped them. So, despite Jung-yeon\\u2019s bad feeling about it, he insists that he has to meet the minister in person.  He says as much to Chief Hong in their VR chat, that Minister Park may know how to find Woo-jin. Chief Hong notes that there\\u2019s a lot about the minister that\\u2019s fishy, from his running of background checks to his willingness to go after Human B all of a sudden. Joon-hyuk shares those thoughts, and figures he\\u2019ll ask when he meets him in person. Chief Hong scoffs that Joon-hyuk isn\\u2019t important enough to meet a minister, but Joon-hyuk has his ways. He starts by visiting the mayor, who\\u2019s initially unwilling to facilitate a meeting. So Joon-hyuk asks him to pass on a simple message: \\u201cI want to talk about Professor Kim Kyu-chul.\\u201d The mayor says that he won\\u2019t ask questions now, but that that stance might change in the event of any problems. He also asks if keeping Ho-soo by his side is wise, but Joon-hyuk says he\\u2019ll take care of the matter.  Ho-soo monitors the Investigation Unit, and when Joon-hyuk leaves the room, he slips a transmitter into his jacket pocket. So when Joon-hyuk gets a text from Minister Park, asking to meet him in Ordinary Earth, Ho-soo and the Human B team follow. As Joon-hyuk waits at the rendezvous spot, a homeless man walks up and hands him a note. It tells Joon-hyuk that the Human B team is nearby, and that the minister will contact him later. When Joon-hyuk leaves without meeting anyone, the Human B team realizes he must have caught on to them. Ho-soo confronts the homeless man to demand the identity of the note-giver. They\\u2019re surprised to hear it was a man\\u2014not Bluebird, then\\u2014but the homeless man can\\u2019t offer any more helpful information. Looking eerie in his determination, Ho-soo orders Secretary Shin to insert a chip into the man, so they can go through his memory and see who gave him the note.  In exchange for hefty compensation, they gain the man\\u2019s permission to insert a chip and hook him up, whereupon Ho-soo scans through his memories. They come upon the scene where he was given the note to pass along, and everyone gapes to recognize the sender: Minister Park. When they report this to Deputy Chief Lee, he murmurs that the minister is turning this into a big issue. Secretary Shin is concerned that while Bluebird is a rogue and can\\u2019t use legal means, Minister Park can end everything for them. Ho-soo asks Lee if he\\u2019ll let this happen, and Lee asks Ho-soo if he\\u2019s truly willing to do anything to stop it. Emphasis on anything.  Soon thereafter, Ho-soo walks into the Investigation Unit, where Joon-hyuk sits alone recalling Jung-yeon\\u2019s warning that Ho-soo is completely disconnected from Human B\\u2014and therefore dangerous. And sure enough, Ho-soo steps inside and levels a tranquilizer gun at Joon-hyuk, face determined. Joon-hyuk asks if inserting a chip and removing his memory is the best idea they could come up with. Ho-soo is clearly conflicted, but he cries that Joon-hyuk has to stop his investigation, because his surfacing memories are causing him immense pain. Joon-hyuk rises carefully from his seat and says that he understands people, and Ho-soo isn\\u2019t the type to shoot him. Ho-soo grasps the gun harder and warns that Joon-hyuk is wrong about him. Joon-hyuk asks him not to do it, saying he doesn\\u2019t want to lose his memories again.  Ho-soo wrestles with his conscience, face twisted with tears and indecision, and finally lowers the gun. But all of a sudden, Joon-hyuk reels back from a shot and looks down at the dark sticking out of the chest. Secretary Shin stands at the door with a henchman holding a gun. Joon-hyuk passes out, and the men carry him out of the room past Ho-soo, who looks conflicted. As they take him down to the garage, Jung-yeon records the scene and sends the clip to Chief Hong. An unconscious Joon-hyuk is taken to an operating room and laid out on a table. Deputy Chief Lee enters with a doctor and gives the order to proceed, watching with a smirk on his face. The doctor picks up a scalpel and holds it to Joon-hyuk\\u2019s neck, ready to insert the chip. Noooo!  Just in the nick of time, Chief Hong rushes into the room with his cops, yelling for them to stop and holding out his badge. Lee\\u2019s men hold the detectives back, however, and Lee tells them that it\\u2019s illegal to enter Smart Earth without a warrant and therefore they have no jurisdiction. So they can only watch helplessly as Lee orders the procedure to continue, and the doctor takes up his scalpel again and holds it to Joon-hyuk\\u2019s neck\\u2026 And then, another voice calls out, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s illegal.\\u201d It\\u2019s Minister Park, and he\\u2019s come with reinforcements in uniforms. He points out that by Smart Earth law, the chip cannot be inserted without the person\\u2019s consent. He scoffs at the deputy chief advertising Smart Earth as crime-free, only to do this. Lowering his speech, he addresses Lee with contempt, asking how he can still be acting like he used to as a student.  Chief Hong\\u2019s men arrest Deputy Chief Lee, Secretary Shin, and the rest, while Hong finally reaches Joon-hyuk\\u2019s side. Minister Park looks genuinely concerned as he looks at Joon-hyuk\\u2019s prone form. When Joon-hyuk wakes up in Ordinary Earth, Min-young tells him that the minister wants to meet him as soon as possible. So Joon-hyuk heads over to the Smart Earth Investigation Unit, where he receives a visit from the minister, who studies Joon-hyuk\\u2019s face and asks if he is Woo-jin\\u2019s older brother. At Joon-hyuk\\u2019s confirmation, he breaks into a wide smile and asks how he\\u2019s been all these years. With real relief, he explains that he\\u2019d thought Joon-hyuk also disappeared back then, along with Woo-jin. Joon-hyuk says that Minister Park was the last person to speak to Woo-jin, and the minister confirms that that\\u2019s true\\u2014yet he wasn\\u2019t the last person to see him. He\\u2019d been worried when he heard Woo-jin was going to meet Professor Han, but by the time he got there himself, Woo-jin had vanished.  Jung-yeon watches through the camera of Joon-hyuk\\u2019s laptop as he asks if Professor Han had kidnapped Woo-jin to start Human B, insistent that the professor is the Human B chairman. After all, Professor Han knew all the technologies needed to run Human B, because they were developed by his research team. Minister Park becomes very still for a moment, then admits that there is a connection between Han\\u2019s research team and Human B. That\\u2019s why he\\u2019s been tracking down all the members of the research team\\u2014but two of them are untraceable: Professor Han and Woo-jin. He explains that in 2022, there was a small, little-known investment presentation for Smart Earth, and that\\u2019s where he\\u2019d seen a twentysomething man. Minister Park shares his suspicion that Woo-jin may not have been a victim at all, but rather the mastermind behind Human B. What if Woo-jin disappeared intentionally and became the chairman?  Joon-hyuk shakes his head violently in denial, insisting that Woo-jin would never do that. But then Jung-yeon\\u2019s voice cuts in to say, \\u201cIt is possible.\\u201d She appears on the laptop screen, and Minister Park recognizes her instantly. Joon-hyuk asks what she means, and she shows them the picture of Woo-jin from 2022, and drops a bomb: It was taken in the Human B chairman\\u2019s office. In flashback, we see that when Jung-yeon was planting something on the chairman\\u2019s computer, something had caught her eye on her way out. It was a painting on the wall \\u2014 the same one hanging behind Woo-jin in the picture. \\u201cI\\u2019m scared too,\\u201d says Jung-yeon. \\u201cI\\u2019m scared that Woo-jin could be the chairman.\\u201dAfter being led around in circles about who the villains may be, we get some solid answers at last! The momentum definitely slowed down a bit this episode, but it was a good break to let us catch our breaths and process all the information being thrown our way. As the mystery in Part 1: Beta Project is slowly being revealed, it seems like the intrigue in Part 2: Brave New World is only growing deeper.  EPISODE 5 RECAP  Part 1: Beta Project A student, PARK MIN-YOUNG (Jung In-sun), walks warily down the street, suspicious of every CCTV and phone camera. She pulls up her hood to avoid exposure, but that doesn\\u2019t stop two students from taking a selfie in front of her, leading her paranoid self to believe they\\u2019re recording her. She arrives at the gates of Handam University, convinced that she\\u2019ll find the answers she\\u2019s looking for here. She beelines toward a public memorial shrine for one of the recently deceased students, and begins telling the people nearby that this is part of a series of murders, not an isolated suicide.  With her frantic eyes and rapid speech, it\\u2019s no wonder that the students, including Sunbae Lee, conclude that she\\u2019s a lunatic and begin taking photos of the spectacle she\\u2019s making of herself. Although she yells for them to stop, they keep clicking away, but just then, Bum-gyun steps in and shields her from the crowd with his jacket. Bum-gyun tells her that he believes her and that he knows the culprit is an alien. As they escape underneath the protection of his jacket, the two introduce themselves in a sweet  moment.  That was a while ago, and now Min-young insists to Woo-jin on the existence of aliens, and that Han Jung-yeon is one of them. When he becomes frustrated with her, much like how he was with Bum-gyun, she shows him a picture of Jung-yeon with a suitcase that has a little toy star on it. His eyes widen immediately\\u2014to him, this is proof that Jung-yeon is really the alien who lived with him and his brother when they were younger. After leaving Min-young, Woo-jin returns to Jung-yeon, who\\u2019s waiting nearby, and grabs her by the shoulders to demand answers. He shows her a picture of himself as a child with his brother and that alien, Byul, and insists that Jung-yeon is that same alien.  However, plot twist: She has amnesia. Jung-yeon admits that she has no memories before the age of eighteen\\u2014she was in a car accident that left her in a coma for a year and caused her amnesia. She recognizes the resemblance to Byul but denies that it\\u2019s her, saying that there\\u2019s no way she would have looked like that ten years ago. However, Woo-jin is firm in his belief that she wouldn\\u2019t age since she\\u2019s an alien. He tells her to smash the toy star if she really wants to confirm that she\\u2019s Byul. Jung-yeon angrily says that the star has meaning to her, and that he\\u2019s crazy if he thinks she\\u2019ll break it just for him to prove a point. Woo-jin scoffs at the amnesia line, and that sets off her temper. She fires back that she\\u2019s undergoing psychotherapy for this, which is a source of pain for her. \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t something you can carelessly mess with!\\u201d she screams.  Even so, doubts have been stirred regarding the backstory of her life that she\\u2019s been repeatedly told. Later that night she asks her father, Professor Han, how she came to have the star. He replies that she made it with her late mother in elementary school. Almost immediately, she goes to Woo-jin\\u2019s house, where he\\u2019s still regretting not believing in his brother. Jung-yeon tells him that she\\u2019s confirmed with her father that the star is an object she made with her mother, and that it\\u2019s one of the few remaining possessions she has of her.  Woo-jin only tells her that he believed her over his own brother because he didn\\u2019t want to be pulled in by Bum-gyun\\u2019s alien conspiracies, but now he\\u2019s realized he should have listened to his twin. The next day, Woo-jin puts on Bum-gyun\\u2019s \\u201cdon\\u2019t-follow-me\\u201d baseball cap and surreptitiously follows Jung-yeon to her therapy session. He peers in through the window, only to find her in the hallway in front of him, knowing that he\\u2019s followed her trail. She tells him to stop being suspicious of her because it could be a series of unfortunate coincidences.  His response is to ask her how this could be coincidence for email handle to be bluebird. She says that Bluebird was her favorite storybook when she was younger, but he counters that bluebird was Byul\\u2019s first word. Again, he tells her to break open the star if she wants to verify the truth. Woo-jin goes to the lab and takes advantage of it being empty to rifle through Professor Han\\u2019s desk before he\\u2019s almost caught by Sunbae Lee. He isn\\u2019t able to get any clues, and then Professor Han and Professor Park also arrive. Full of suspicions, Woo-jin just stands there awkwardly staring at the head professor until prompted by the younger professor to mind his manners.  Sunbae Lee is a huge suck-up to Professor Han, so Woo-jin decides to try to the other professor for information. He buys coffee for Professor Park, trying to butter him up to find out more about Jung-yeon\\u2019s supposed memory loss. However, just the mention of Jung-yeon\\u2019s memory loss stops Professor Park cold, and he shoves the cup of coffee back into Woo-jin\\u2019s hands. Later, when Woo-jin secretly searches through Professor Han\\u2019s things again, he only finds a single father-daughter photo. However, on the desk there\\u2019s a pen with the Eun-sung Mental Hospital logo on it. He remembers that\\u2019s where Jung-yeon went last time to follow up on a lead before being attacked by Min-young.  He goes back to Eun-sung Mental Hospital, where he calls out to Min-young. She crawls out of her hiding place when he arrives, and she explains to him that a bright light flashed in the sky before someone kidnapped Bum-gyun. They explore the dark corridors, looking for more clues, and freak out when they\\u2019re caught up in a bright light. But it\\u2019s only Chief Hong, who is also there investigating the case. Min-young\\u2019s taser makes Chief Hong assume she\\u2019s the culprit, but Woo-jin explains that she\\u2019s just a witness. Min-young jumps in and provides more details on her story, starting to talk about aliens and UFOs. At that point, Chief Hong hints to Woo-jin that he thinks Min-young may not be all there upstairs, but she whips out her student ID, shocking them both with the fact that she\\u2019s a medical student from a different university.  They search the spooky hallways together, when suddenly Woo-jin saves Min-young from stepping on broken glass\\u2014and mixed in with the glass is a pool of blood, still red and wet, indicating that it\\u2019s fresh. The trio follow the trail of blood, slumping in disappointment when they come to a dead end. The men are skeptical when Min-young starts tapping the mirror mounted at the end of the hall, until the knocking betrays hollowness behind it. They push the sliding mirror backward to reveal a secret passageway, and finally, that dank cell where we\\u2019d seen Bum-gyun being held captive. It\\u2019s empty now, with more fresh blood and signs of a struggle, and Woo-jin runs outside in hopes of catching up to the culprits.  Back at her house, Jung-yeon goes through her childhood belongings, including the bluebird storybook she was told she loved when she was younger. She notices a sticker on the front page, and when she peels it back, she discovers a child\\u2019s writing hidden underneath, which reads \\u201cByul noona.\\u201d Seeing this, she immediately breaks open the toy star with an angry slam. Inside she discovers a scroll of paper and, written on it, \\u201cByul \\u2665 Woo-jin.\\u201d Woo-jin and Min-young race outside the abandoned mental hospital, and find an ambulance that wasn\\u2019t there before, with a bluebird logo on it. The ambulance starts to drive away, and Woo-jin takes off running after it, very nearly reaching its rear doors.  Woo-jin shouts out for his hyung, and a bloodied hand appears in the window. Then Bum-gyun\\u2019s face appears, and he shouts for his brother. But the ambulance continues to speed along, and Woo-jin can\\u2019t keep up. He starts to fall behind as Bum-gyun is yanked back away from the window by an unseen force. He\\u2019s forced to stop running, and his brother is carried away. Part 2: Brave New World  In the empty room where they once lived together, Joon-hyuk has an emotional breakdown, regretting not having listened to his brother Woo-jin when he expressed his burdens. Joon-hyuk reveals that he\\u2019s Bum-gyun, to the surprise of Jung-yeon (aka Bluebird), who watches from her surveillance screen, and Ho-soo, who spies at the door. When Ho-soo reports back, Deputy Chief Lee reveals that he also knows who Bum-gyun is. As soon as Joon-hyuk leaves the premises, Jung-yeon texts him to meet at a predetermined location, and Ho-soo continues to follow him surreptitiously, on orders from Human B.  Joon-hyuk waits for a while in front of a merry-go-round in an empty amusement park until Jung-yeon shows up in person, not seeing that he\\u2019s being observed by Ho-soo, Chief Deputy Lee, and a group of Human B goons. But just as they start to discuss important matters like the location of Woo-jin, they\\u2019re interrupted by those Human B goons, who race toward them. Jung-yeon tells Joon-hyuk that they need to split up in order not to get caught, and promptly runs away. She escapes to a small corner of the amusement park, where she sets up a temporary computer system that she uses to hack into the electric grid of the amusement park. She shuts down the power just in time, throwing everyone into darkness before they get to her.  It gives her a comfortable head start on an escape, but the goons are still in pursuit. Ho-soo drives up in his car and identifies himself, telling her to either come with him or go with Human B. She gets in the car, and it drives off just before the goons get to it. When they\\u2019re safely away, Ho-soo gives her an ultimatum knowing that she\\u2019s the legendary hacker Bluebird: Block his memories again, or he\\u2019ll call Human B. She tells him to have Human B block his memories again, and he argues that she\\u2019s unblocking them without people\\u2019s permissions. She retorts that he\\u2019s willingly making this choice to forget, so she won\\u2019t do it for him. What she\\u2019s seeking to do is restore the memories of the Smart Earth citizens, thereby giving them back the ability to choose for themselves.  When Ho-soo asks her why she\\u2019s doing this, Jung-yeon answers that it\\u2019s because everything began with her. When she refuses again to do as he asks and erase his memory, Ho-soo hits the alert button on his phone to call Human B. Jung-yeon pulls out her gun and levels it at Ho-soo\\u2019s head, keeping him frozen in place until she can safely escape. Later, Deputy Chief Lee reveals to his secretary that he knows who Jung-yeon is because they went to university together. A memory of himself, Woo-jin, and Jung-yeon surfaces, revealing that he is Sunbae Lee. Aha!  When Chief Hong and Joon-hyuk debrief back at Ordinary Earth HQ, the younger detective says that he was surprised to learn that Bluebird was Jung-yeon; he had half-expected and half-hoped that Bluebird would be his brother. But now that it\\u2019s been outed to Human B that he\\u2019s acquainted with Bluebird, it\\u2019ll be harder to freely move around Smart Earth, which causes a round of sighs. The woman doctor who performed surgery on Park Jin-gyu is revealed to be a grown-up Min-young. She sits by his bedside when he asks for a full recovery of his memories, and warns him that taking the Care Chip out in and of itself is a dangerous procedure. Even if it were successful, it would leave behind a scar.  She shows him the back of her ear, bearing a similar wound to Joon-hyuk\\u2019s. She explains that the wound isn\\u2019t recent, maybe 20 years old, and back then it wasn\\u2019t a Care Chip, it was a blue bug. Detective Oh and Dong-soo chat outside the building, and the detective wonders about the latest gossip regarding the strange chemistry between Joon-hyuk and Dr. Min-young. When Dong-soo begins talking about their long-time sometimes friendly, sometimes familial relationship, Joon-hyuk walks up behind Detective Oh who expresses disbelief that there isn\\u2019t more going on between them.  He thinks it may be because Dr. Min-young is way more attractive than Joon-hyuk, and he begins rattling off his senior\\u2019s negative qualities. Dong-soo\\u2019s eyes grow wide, knowing that Joon-hyuk is right behind him, and he tries to mitigate the damage (at least for himself) by excessively complimenting all of Joon-hyuk\\u2019s qualities. They both end up being bopped on the head and scolded by Chief Hong. Team Ordinary Earth gathers to discuss the Bluebird problem, and Joon-hyuk says that he may know someone who can get him back on Smart Earth, despite Human B\\u2019s attempts to limit his movements.  He means Mayor Yoon, and drops in to confer with him. He says pointedly that most Smart Earth citizens think that the mayor is the CEO of Human B, rather than the mayor of their city. Clearly, it touches a nerve, and Mayor Yoon gives Joon-hyuk permission to continue his investigation in Smart Earth, while also warning him that Ho-soo may be working for the other side. Later, Mayor Yoon meets with Minister Park at a sushi restauarant, and we see that it\\u2019s a silver-haired Professor Park who\\u2019s clearly moved up several pay grades since 2017. In their small talk, the professor acts like the human trash he is, gloating about how he procured the rarest and most expensive organic fish through his connections, and how he finds it funny that Ordinary Earth kids color their skies yellow because they\\u2019ve never known a world otherwise (due to pollution that isn\\u2019t present on Smart Earth).  Mayor Yoon looks uncomfortable, but he forges on to make his request. Minister Park guesses his intent and emphasizes the incredible amount of money that is on the line, with all this foreign interest in the Human B system. The mayor points out that all the money in the world won\\u2019t be enough to solve the problem if this issue gets out. The mayor therefore requests Minister Park to obtain a search warrant for him, so they can investigate the claims of Human B blocking people\\u2019s memories. After some considerable wrangling, Minister Park agrees when Mayor Yoon tells him that there have been criminal incidents occurring on Smart Earth (but I don\\u2019t trust his nefarious motives for giving the search warrant).  Deputy Chief Lee asks the chairman what to do after apprising him on the latest information that Bluebird is Jung-yeon. He receives a reply in an unintelligible robotic message, only understood by him. Afterwards, he has a holographic meeting with Ho-soo, who thought that he would now be relieved of the troubling memories that are gradually returning to him. However, Deputy Chief Lee coerces Ho-soo into spying on Joon-hyuk a little longer. Although Ho-soo is angry, he realizes that they may keep using him until the end, he wants to rid himself of those memories so much that he acquiesces.  Staying true to his efforts, Ho-soo approaches Joon-hyuk the next morning and asks him out for a meal together. They\\u2019re about to leave when he receives a text from Human B, so he leaves after making his excuses to Joon-hyuk, saying that he has an emergency situation to deal with. However, when he arrives at Human B, he realizes that the text was not sent by Deputy Chief Lee, which means that he was duped by Bluebird. He rushes out, back on his way to Joon-hyuk, who has just received a text from Bluebird. It\\u2019s a picture of Woo-jin in March 2022, looking dapper in a suit at an art gallery. Joon-hyuk hears the doors slide open and Jung-yeon appears, getting to the point immediately: \\u201cWoo-jin is on Smart Earth.\\u201dHurtling along at breakneck speed, Circle keeps us riveted to the two timelines as Woo-jin and Joon-hyuk each find an answer to a crucial question. Woo-jin battles distrust and confusion about the girl who could be an alien, while Joon-hyuk seeks to understand why a perceived enemy might be helping them.  EPISODE 4 RECAP  Ten years ago. Little Bum-gyun sits in his room, timing himself as he solves the Rubik\\u2019s cube. Outside, Woo-jin is working on his homework on the living room floor. When their strange guest walks through the room and almost steps on his project, he shows her his chart of the planets and asks where she\\u2019s from: \\u201cJupiter? Mars?\\u201d Bum-gyun calls Woo-jin into his room to challenge him to a race to solve the cube\\u2019s puzzle. As the timer ticks the seconds by, Bum-gyun looks worriedly at Woo-jin\\u2019s progress, until Woo-jin wins. He tells his older brother gleefully that no matter his high marks in school, Bum-gyun will always lose to him. Then, blowing a raspberry, the little imp runs out of the room. Bum-gyun chases him into the living room, where the sight of something stops them in their tracks. Then, Woo-jin\\u2019s face breaks into a grin as he tells his brother: \\u201cSee? I told you she\\u2019s from outer space.\\u201d We don\\u2019t see what surprised them, but their eerie guest turns her head to look at the brothers.  Part 1: Beta Project Woo-jin discovers the blue worm in a pot in Jung-yeon\\u2019s room, while the mysterious Jung-yeon stands outside a decrepit building called Eunsung Psychiatric Hospital. She gets a call from Woo-jin, and tells him exactly where she is. He tells her that he\\u2019ll come to her. Woo-jin scoops up the blue worm into a plastic bag (is that secure enough?) and heads out. Jung-yeon tries the locked gate of the premises and thinks back to the text she got from an unknown number that simply said, \\u201c2 p.m. at Eunsung Psychiatric Hospital.\\u201d She gets another text that makes her look towards the building, then finds a way inside. As she walks down the deserted corridor of the hospital, she looks around nervously, until suddenly, a hooded figure appears before her. The figure tackles her to the ground and tries to shock her with a taser. In the struggle, Jung-yeon manages to push the assailant off of her, and hears a distinctly female grunt of pain.  As she turns to run, the woman grabs her again, and this time manages to bring the taser right up to her neck. Just in time, Woo-jin arrives and pushes her off of Jung-yeon. The hooded woman gets up and runs, while Jung-yeon shouts at Woo-jin to go after her. Woo-jin chases the woman through the narrow streets outside, until he loses sight of her. There\\u2019s no one in the next alley, except a woman in a black tracksuit, who walks past him while putting on earphones. Woo-jin gets to the end of the alley and finds a dead end. To the side is a discarded brown jacket, like the one the assailant wore over her black clothes. He looks sharply behind him, but the woman in a tracksuit has already disappeared.  When he gets back to the hospital, Jung-yeon shows him the text the hooded woman had sent her. She suggests that they go to the police with all they know now, but Woo-jin wants some answers first. He shows her the bug and asks why she has it. Jung-yeon tells him that it came out of her dead friend\\u2019s body, and that she\\u2019d held on to it without knowing what it was until now. Woo-jin asks if she hadn\\u2019t trusted him even when they were working together, and Jung-yeon admits that because of Bum-gyun she hadn\\u2019t trusted him completely back then, but she does now. Woo-jin asks her if she trusts Bum-gyun\\u2019s innocence too, and stresses that he\\u2019s not the criminal. Jung-yeon agrees to believe that since Woo-jin does.  They take the worms to Chief Hong at the police station and tell him everything. As Woo-jin tries to describe the assailant\\u2019s face, he comes up with unhelpful gems like \\u201cShe has round eyes\\u201d and \\u201cShe looks like a nice person,\\u201d which understandably frustrates Jung-yeon. But it seems Chief Hong may be the Korean Sherlock after all, \\u2019cause those vague descriptors are enough for him to come up with a sketch that matches Woo-jin\\u2019s memory of the woman. They are very impressed and ask how he got such details out of what Woo-jin said, and he tells them that it\\u2019s his sixth sense.  In flashback, though, we see him going through the CCTV footage from the day of Kim Nan-hee\\u2019s death. He zooms in on the face of the woman who had visited the student before Woo-jin and Jung-yeon. He gets a clear shot of her face, and his sketch today matches it exactly. Ha. Chief Hong wraps up their interview and gets up, but Woo-jin stops him to add one last detail. He tells the detective about his last conversation with Bum-gyun, and how he\\u2019d said that the criminal was \\u201cBluebird.\\u201d Jung-yeon frowns at Woo-jin, but stays silent. Outside the police station, she smacks him hard on the head, observing that he\\u2019d doubted her as well. Guessing that the \\u201cbluebird\\u201d in her email address was what had caused him to search her room, she points out that his brother knows her name and wouldn\\u2019t use an alias when referring to \\u201cthe criminal.\\u201d  Woo-jin still thinks it\\u2019s an odd coincidence, but Jung-yeon is focused on unraveling the mystery of that name now. Woo-jin notices a bloody tear on Jung-yeon\\u2019s jeans and suggests they go to the hospital. Jung-yeon coolly dismisses the cut and says she\\u2019ll be fine, but when the doctor puts some antiseptic on it, she starts whimpering like a child with a boo-boo. While she\\u2019s being treated, Woo-jin leaves the outpatient ward and runs into Professor Han, who\\u2019s walking out of the elevator. They exchange greetings, and the professor says that he\\u2019s here to see his child, who got into an accident. When Woo-jin gets back with two cans of coffee, he sees Professor Han sitting with Jung-yeon. His eyes widen as Jung-yeon introduces him to her dad, the professor. They explain that they\\u2019re classmates, and Woo-jin quickly takes his leave. He lingers close enough to listen to the professor teasing his daughter about Woo-jin, and asking if he\\u2019s the reason she\\u2019s been skipping her treatments. She denies it, but Woo-jin smiles to himself before leaving.  As he walks past the bakery near his college, he remembers Bum-gyun working inside and his face falls. Inside the Psychiatric Hospital, Bum-gyun sits in silence inside a locked room. When he hears footsteps, he gets up and looks around wildly. As the steps come closer, he jumps up on the nearby stretcher and pretends to be unconscious. Somewhere on a different floor of the hospital, Chief Hong and his partner look through the rooms. The partner clearly thinks this is a wild goose chase and says that Woo-jin \\u2014 with his blue bugs and blue birds \\u2014 is as weird as Hong is. A man in scrubs walks into Bum-gyun\\u2019s room with a syringe. He prepares to inject something into Bum-gyun\\u2019s neck, when Bum-gyun grabs his hand and bites his arm. This makes the mysterious man scream in pain, but he manages to overpower Bum-gyun and inject the suspicious drug.  Chief Hong hears the sound and says they\\u2019ll search the place one more time. Meanwhile, the man in scrubs takes out a blue worm and positions it under the nostril of a now-unconscious Bum-gyun. Oh no! The next day, Jung-yeon arrives at Woo-jin\\u2019s place and calls to tell him that she\\u2019s coming up. Just out of the shower, Woo-jin is thrown into a panic as he speed-cleans his room and puts on a shirt backwards and inside-out over his towel in his hurry. Jung-yeon notices the backwards shirt, but suppresses her smile as she walks inside. Woo-jin belatedly realizes this and quickly turns it inside-out, as she settles down on the floor. She notices a pile of discarded clothes shoved hurriedly under a table, and sweetly puts a pillow against it to make it look like she didn\\u2019t see it.  He asks why she hadn\\u2019t told him about her father, and she retorts that she never asked about his dad either. He can\\u2019t argue with that, so he tells her to level with him, so he isn\\u2019t confused about her. She asks what could be so confusing, then suddenly gets a coy look on her face. She gives him a flirtatious shove as if he\\u2019d said something forward, and Woo-jin falls over himself to make it clear that he wasn\\u2019t talking about that kind of confusion! She laughs at his seriousness and tells him to focus on organizing their findings. Woo-jin\\u2019s sunbae speaks to Professor Park about convincing Professor Han not to take Woo-jin onto their team. When Professor Han arrives, he immediately mentions Woo-jin and how close he seemed to Jung-yeon. Professor Park exchanges glances with the sunbae and tells Professor Han that having Woo-jin on the team would make them uncomfortable.  Professor Han turns from genial to glacial, as he points out that he\\u2019s the head researcher and he needs Woo-jin on the team. Professor Park backs down and leaves, and Professor Han sighs to himself. Our amateur sleuths set up Bum-gyun\\u2019s murder conspiracy chart on Woo-jin\\u2019s wall and look through all the pictures in his camera. Jung-yeon notices Woo-jin\\u2019s sober expression as he studies his brother\\u2019s notes, and she suddenly exclaims and points at a picture of herself. Woo-jin looks up to see what she found, and snorts when Jung-yeon waxes lyrical over how good she looks in the shot and asks him to send it to her. Seeing him laugh, she tells him to smile more, and says that it\\u2019s not easy to smile in his situation. She promises that they\\u2019ll find Bum-gyun, telling him to \\u201ctrust this noona.\\u201d He scoffs at her claim of being older and asks when she was born. She reveals it was April, which makes him tight-lipped about his own birth month.  Just then, Woo-jin gets a call from Bum-gyun\\u2019s number. The caller on the other side tells him to come to a certain park at 2 p.m., alone. Woo-jin tells Jung-yeon that it\\u2019s \\u201cthat woman,\\u201d and they go to the park together. Jung-yeon hides, while Woo-jin waits out in the open. Half an hour passes with no sight of the woman, until she comes up behind Jung-yeon with her taser. Jung-yeon\\u2019s yell brings Woo-jin running, and he manages to catch the hooded woman this time. Grabbing her by the hand holding the taser, he asks who she is and how she had his brother\\u2019s phone. In a near manic state, the woman yells that he was supposed to come alone, and she won\\u2019t say a word in front of Jung-yeon. Woo-jin asks Jung-yeon to leave for a bit, and Jung-yeon begrudgingly agrees but tells him not to lose the woman.  After she walks away, the woman asks him why he\\u2019s hanging out with an alien. The conversation is frustratingly circular for Woo-jin, as the woman keeps saying that Jung-yeon is an alien and knows where Bum-gyun is. Finally, when Woo-jin yells that there are no such things as aliens, she shows him a picture of Jung-yeon standing on the road with a suitcase. He asks what\\u2019s so strange about the picture, and the woman zooms the image in to focus on a star-shaped accessory on the suitcase. Woo-jin\\u2019s eyes widen, and the woman asks if he still thinks the girl is Han Jung-yeon. As he slowly looks up at her, she asks if he really even wants to find his brother. Jung-yeon is waiting at a bench, some distance away, and just as she gets to the end of her patience, she sees Woo-jin walking towards her alone. She asks if he lost the woman again, but he doesn\\u2019t answer. Instead, as he looks at her, he remembers the yellow star attached to the suitcase that his dad carried out of their house, when he left with the alien woman.  Jung-yeon asks what\\u2019s wrong, and Woo-jin remembers running out into the living room with his brother after solving the Rubik\\u2019s cube, and finding the alien drawing a complicated chart of the star system on their window. The little Woo-jin in his memory smiles and tells his brother that he was right about her being from outer space. Frustrated with his silence, Jung-yeon starts to walk past him, when he reaches out and stops her by the arm. He sighs and takes out his phone. Showing her the star, he asks how she got it. She says that she always had it, but Woo-jin wants to know how it came into her possession. Looking defensive, she says, \\u201cWhy do I have to tell you that?\\u201d And Woo-jin answers, \\u201cBecause I gave it to you.\\u201d In flashback, we see Little Woo-jin holding out the star to his alien. \\u201cFrom today your name is Byul [which means star].\\u201d  \\u201cByul,\\u201d says Woo-jin, tears falling from his eyes. \\u201cYou\\u2019re Byul.\\u201d Then taking out the old Polaroid picture from his pocket, he hands it to her. Jung-yeon pales as she looks at the alien woman with the two kids beside her. \\u201cThat\\u2019s you, and that\\u2019s me, beside you,\\u201d Woo-jin tells her. Grabbing her by the shoulder, he yells that she\\u2019s Byul. Looking truly shaken, Jung-yeon says that she doesn\\u2019t know who who she is either. \\u201cI\\u2026\\u201d she says, her voice trembling, \\u201chave no memories.\\u201d Back at Professor Han\\u2019s office, he treats a bite wound on his arm. He gets a call from someone who says that Jung-yeon skipped her session again and that it would be hard to get her memories back at this rate. He promises to speak to her, and his eyes fall on his monitor, which shows a live feed of Bum-gyun in the old hospital. In the park, Jung-yeon confesses that she has no memories of her life before she turned eighteen. Woo-jin looks shocked as this sinks in.  Part 2: Brave New World Ho-soon yells at Joon-hyuk to stop looking into Human B, and asks him who he is. Joon-hyuk looks tormented as he admits that he doesn\\u2019t know who he is: Kim Joon-hyuk or someone else entirely. In flashback, Chief Hong shows the detective a clip of the little Kim boys solving the Rubik\\u2019s cube and tells him that from this day, he\\u2019s Kim Joon-hyuk. Later, outside his hospital room, Chief Hong argues to the lady doctor, IN-YOUNG, that Joon-hyuk has the right to know. Joon-hyuk overhears them and asks what he doesn\\u2019t know. \\u201cYou told me that child died! Is he alive?\\u201d Seeing his distress at being unable to remember, Chief Hong hands him a suitcase and says: \\u201cThis is the memory footage your twin left behind.\\u201d  In-young warns him against watching it, arguing that it could keep him stuck in the past, but Joon-hyuk needs to know. Alone, he watches the moment on the road when Woo-jin begged Bum-gyun to give up his quest to find the alien and stay by his side. We don\\u2019t see whose perspective this memory is from. In the present, Joon-hyuk tells Ho-soon that bad memories are also part of life. \\u201cNo matter how upsetting, cruel, or horrible they may be, they are still part of who you are. That\\u2019s why you have to accept it. That\\u2019s what I did.\\u201d Conflicted but stubborn, Ho-soon says that the choice Joon-hyuk made isn\\u2019t necessarily the right one. He stumbles away and heads back to Smart Earth. Reaching home, Ho-soon begins to weep and starts to pull off his tie. Suddenly, he looks at it and realizes that it\\u2019s the same one his girlfriend had given him five years ago. He\\u2019d been wearing it all this time, without knowing why.  In Ordinary Earth, Joon-hyuk sits with his eyes closed for hours, making Detective Oh and Dong-soo wonder if he\\u2019s sleeping sitting up. Just to check, they tip-toe close and wave their hands before his face. But when Dong-soo puts a finger under Joon-hyuk\\u2019s nose to check his breathing, he gets his answer as Joon-hyuk chomps down on the digit. Joon-hyuk berates Dong-soo for being unable to locate Bluebird, and they wonder how good Bluebird must be to be working for Human B. Joon-hyuk points out that they must find the hacker: \\u201cThat\\u2019s the only way it\\u2019ll end for you\\u2026 and me,\\u201d he tells Chief Hong and Doctor In-young. Ho-soon visits the Human B building and asks to meet Deputy Chief Lee. He confronts the man about Human B blocking the citizens\\u2019 memories. When the deputy chief denies it, Ho-soon brings up Bluebird, and asks if he should go to the reporters to test how \\u201ctechnically impossible\\u201d his resurfacing memories are.  When Deputy Chief Lee asks why he came to him instead of going to the press, Ho-soon says it\\u2019s because there\\u2019s something he wants: \\u201cPlease, block my memories again.\\u201d Lee\\u2019s cool smile drops away in surprise. Secretary Shin walks in just then and whispers something in his ears. Deputy Chief Lee invites Ho-soon to come with him, since there is something he should see. Back in Dong-soo\\u2019s lair, Min-ji\\u2019s uncle wakes up and looks wildly about. As his memories come back, he cries, \\u201cWhy did I? Why did I?\\u201d He remembers what he did again and asks why he did \\u201cthat\\u201d to Min-ji. Chief Hong grabs him by the collar and yells at him to confirm that he was an accomplice in the kidnapping.  Dong-soo points out how odd it is that all these memories are coming back now. Joon-hyuk thinks back to Ho-soon saying that he\\u2019s afraid of his memories returning, and frowns. He wants to reconnect the cable to Min-ji\\u2019s uncle\\u2019s chip to find out more. In-young refuses, since it could be dangerous to his health, but Uncle asks for it to be done. He says that he needs to know. When Dong-soo looks up the memories of the day of the kidnapping, he finds the file miraculously unblocked this time. They watch as Little Min-ji is put into the car trunk by her kidnapper. She looks towards her uncle and asks him to save her. As the trunk lid closes, the video blacks out and Bluebird\\u2019s logo flashes on the screen. Deputy Chief Lee and his entourage walk out of Human B, as the memory footage suddenly becomes accessible again in Ordinary Earth. They watch Uncle walk towards Little Min-ji in a warehouse, and every time the video blacks out, Bluebird\\u2019s logo appears and the footage resumes.  As they watch the uncle tie Min-ji up and gag her, Chief Hong shuts his eyes at her muffled sobs. Dong-soo observes that Bluebird wasn\\u2019t the one blocking the citizens\\u2019 memories, and Joon-hyuk agrees: \\u201cHe was bringing them back.\\u201d \\u201cBut why?\\u201d asks Dong-soo, as the officials at Human B\\u2019s control room scramble to fight Bluebird hacking into their system. The logo flashes bright on the screen as Deputy Chief Lee arrives and thunders at his subordinate for not being able to stop the hacker from getting into their system again. His chips turns red, then green, calming Lee down. The deputy chief tells Ho-soon in private that Bluebird is the one causing misery by bringing back blocked memories. He offers to block Ho-soon\\u2019s memories again, but asks for something in return.  Back at Ordinary Earth, Dong-soo wonders who the hacker really is. Detective Oh asks if he\\u2019s after justice, or if he has a grudge against Human B too. Joon-hyuk gets up and says he\\u2019s leaving to meet Bluebird. When Chief Hong asks how, he just says, \\u201cSmart Earth. That\\u2019s where we lost him.\\u201d In a dark room full of complex computers, a woman sits at a console, a cap hiding her face. As she works, her eyes land on one screen and she plays the footage. It\\u2019s from Ho-soon\\u2019s perspective, and shows Joon-hyuk shouting, \\u201cBluebird is Human B. Human B is blocking their memories!\\u201d As Joon-hyuk turns to look at Ho-soon, she stops the footage on his face. Joon-hyuk is walking into Smart Earth\\u2019s terminal, when he gets a call from Ho-soon. He asks if he\\u2019s all right and guesses that Ho-soon\\u2019s care chip is making him feel better. As Ho-soon hangs up, he thinks of Deputy Chief Lee\\u2019s request. All he has to do is find out who Joon-hyuk was before he took on his current identity, and Lee promised to block Ho-soon\\u2019s bad memories again.  As Joon-hyuk walks through the terminal, a woman in a cap bumps into him, before walking away. He doesn\\u2019t catch her face, but as he keeps walking, he hears his phone ring. He takes it out, only to realize that the ringing is coming from another pocket. He finds an unfamiliar phone there, with a call from an unknown number flashing on the screen. We see that the woman in the cap slipped the phone into his pocket as she walked past him earlier. He takes the call and hears a distorted voice ask, \\u201cDetective Kim, are you looking for me?\\u201d \\u201cBluebird?\\u201d he asks. \\u201cWhy are you unblocking people\\u2019s memories?\\u201d \\u201cDo you want to know?\\u201d she answers, \\u201cThen come out.\\u201d A map pops up on the phone and Joon-hyuk runs back out to Ordinary Earth, following the blinking dot on it. Ho-soon, who was watching him from a distance, follows. Bluebird has him running through a maze of roads and tunnels, until he finally arrives at the imposing gates of Woo-jin\\u2019s old university.  Memories of walking through the gate flash in his mind, and he hears Chief Hong say that this is the footage that his twin left behind. He answers Bluebird\\u2019s call by asking, \\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\\u201d He gets another location on the map, and when he reaches it, it\\u2019s Woo-jin\\u2019s old apartment building. He remembers Bum-gyun sitting in that apartment and promising never to go back to jail and never to leave Woo-jin\\u2019s side. In flashback, we see Joon-hyuk watching this footage on screen from Woo-jin\\u2019s perspective. Ah, noooo! He gets another call and this time asks: \\u201cYou know me, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d Bluebird answers: \\u201cI think you know me too.\\u201d Joon-hyuk begs to know where Bluebird is, and gets yet another location on the map.  He stops before the bakery this time, recalling Bum-gyun\\u2019s claims to Woo-jin that it was the alien\\u2019s hideout. The final location is the motel where Bum-gyun stayed after getting out of jail. He walks up the steps and recalls Little Bum-gyun telling his brother, \\u201cI\\u2019ll always find you wherever you are.\\u201d He also remembers Woo-jin swearing never to talk to Bum-gyun if he leaves now. Finally, he remembers Bum-gyun\\u2019s promise never to leave Woo-jin\\u2019s side. He enters the room and his mind fills up the empty room with how it used to look when Bum-gyun stayed there. He looks around, when suddenly he hears Woo-jin ask if Bum-gyun killed those students. He turns around to see that scene replay before him, with the two brothers standing there. Then, the perspective shifts and Woo-jin is speaking directly to him: \\u201cWhy do you keep living in a different world by yourself? Why?\\u201d  Joon-hyuk remembers all times Bum-gyun hurt Woo-jin because of his need to find the alien, and softly apologizes to Woo-jin now. Tearing up, he says, \\u201cI should have told you everything. No, I should have stopped.\\u201d The specter of Woo-jin vanishes but leaves Joon-hyuk steeped in memories of Woo-jin telling him that he\\u2019d had a hard time without him, that he needed him. Joon-hyuk calls out: \\u201cWoo-jin. I\\u2019m here. It\\u2019s me, Bum-gyun.\\u201d He breaks down crying, and in a distant dark room, a Rubik\\u2019s cube falls from Bluebird\\u2019s hand. The camera pans up to her face, and we see an unchanged Jung-yeon staring at the screen in shock. Hoarsely, she breathes: \\u201cKim Bum-gyun.\\u201dI can\\u2019t believe there\\u2019s only one month left of this show. Please don\\u2019t leave me, Circle, because you are just THAT amazing. Just when I thought I could see the ends of the mystery unraveling, shocking plot twists suddenly blew all my theories to smithereens. And the rich ethical questions raised by the existence of memory-altering technology are so fascinating that I want to explore every facet of that technology\\u2019s implications.  EPISODE 3 RECAP  Bum-gyun limps toward an old abandoned building in the dark when his phone rings\\u2014it\\u2019s Woo-jin, telling him to come home. Bum-gyun tells his brother that he\\u2019ll be right there after he checks something out, and tells him that the culprit is Bluebird. But as he hangs up the phone, a bright white light\\u2014reminiscent of the UFO beam from their childhood\\u2014blinds him, and he stumbles back. Part 1: Beta Project The scene cuts to a tense confrontation between Woo-jin and Jung-yeon, where he asks if she is really who she says she is. She\\u2019s confused initially and becomes afraid as he grabs her collar, but she quickly recovers and brushes his hand aside as she says that he\\u2019s as deranged as his brother if he believes she\\u2019s an alien.  Having evidence from the hidden camera of her having been in his brother\\u2019s motel room, Woo-jin demands to know why she would search a crazy man\\u2019s room. She claims that it\\u2019s because she thought that Bum-gyun was the murderer because he showed up at each of the suicide scenes. Woo-jin reveals that Bum-gyun is missing and grabs her as he accuses her of being the real culprit. That\\u2019s when the senior (who was picking on Woo-jin earlier) comes up to them to defend Jung-yeon. Woo-jin tells him to buzz off in a blatant sign of disrespect that causes the sunbae to throw the first punch in what becomes an all-out brawl. They\\u2019re taken to a police station, where Chief Hong is working on the Handam serial suicide case.  When Chief Hong overhears that Woo-jin is Bum-gyun\\u2019s brother, he suddenly takes an interest in him and begins asking nosy questions about Bum-gyun\\u2019s whereabouts. Woo-jin desperately pleads for Chief Hong to look for his brother because he\\u2019s definitely missing\\u2014it\\u2019s unlike Bum-gyun not to keep in contact with Woo-jin even throughout all his obsessive hunts for the alien. Jung-yeon watches the entire conversation play out, seeming to understand the direness of the situation for Woo-jin now that she\\u2019s been given the full context for his outburst. When they\\u2019re finally released, Jung-yeon looks up at the sunbae with a flirtatious smile, asking him to cover for her if her father asks about her. But she leaves with Woo-jin, who is perplexed by where she\\u2019s leading him. Regardless, he ends up following her when she says she has more information on the serial suicide case that his brother was tracking when he went missing.  She brings him to a modest single room that she\\u2019s been keeping for her private use to pursue the murderer. She shows him her logbook that contains the records of all the strange deaths that have been occurring at Handam, and when he asks her why she\\u2019s so interested in this case, she pulls out a photo of herself and her best friend, So-yoon. She was one of the first victims, and Jung-yeon begins tearing up as she reminisces about their close friendship. This brings Woo-jin immediately back to an old memory of himself and Bum-gyun watching something extremely sad on TV while the blank-faced alien just stared on. When Woo-jin asked the alien if it didn\\u2019t feel sad, it replied in the affirmative, asking Woo-jin why it should feel sad. The stark contrast between the crying Jung-yeon in front of him and the ever-stoic alien diminishes his suspicion of her.  She then tells him a key piece of information: Approximately a month before each of the victims died, they began acting weird and suffered frequent nosebleeds and headaches. Jung-yeon asks if she can see Bum-gyun\\u2019s research, and they go back to the motel room where the innkeeper is throwing out his stuff. He tells them that they\\u2019ll have to pay the late rent fees if they want it. With all of Bum-gyun\\u2019s stuff in tow, they go back to school, where Jung-yeon sees the camera full of her pictures. She asks why his brother thought she was an alien, and Woo-jin tells her that it\\u2019s because she resembles someone from their childhood. Seeing a list of students in Bum-gyun\\u2019s notebook, Woo-jin remembers that one of his classmates listed in the notebook, Kim Nan-hee, also had a severe nosebleed that made her leave class.  They run to her dorm where an old security guard tries to stop them from entering, but they push through anyway. When they get to her room, it\\u2019s in complete disarray (with flecks of blood everywhere), and when Jung-yeon looks out the window, she sees Kim Nan-hee\\u2019s silhouette standing on the edge of a tall building. Woo-jin and Jung-yeon run to her, but she jumps before they even get close, and they witness her fall. They look upon her oddly broken corpse, and in horror, Woo-jin sees a bright blue worm crawl out of her nostril. Chief Hong is alerted as soon as the suicide is reported, and he interviews the same security guard from Kim Nan-hee\\u2019s building, who tells him about Jung-yeon and Woo-jin having searched for her right before her death. He also tells Chief Hong that before them, another small female student had come looking for Nan-hee as well.  As he gets some refreshments for a shell-shocked Jung-yeon, Woo-jin ponders his brother\\u2019s last statement to him, wondering if Bum-gyun meant \\u201cblue bug\\u201d and not \\u201cbluebird.\\u201d Jung-yeon blames herself, thinking that if they had only gotten to Kim Nan-hee a little faster, this wouldn\\u2019t have happened. They have a quiet moment of solace, understanding each other\\u2019s mutual sadness. Professor HWANG YONG-WOO stares out the window, tapping his unlit cigarette in frustration. Professor Park, who seems to be a subordinate of his, sidles up by his side and remarks that kids nowadays are so weak and extremely emotional (perhaps referring to the recent suicides). Professor Hwang snaps his cigarette in half and reprimands Professor Park by telling him to watch his words.  In the dead of night, Woo-jin and Jung-yeon take a flashlight to search the spot of Nan-hee\\u2019s death for any sign of the blue bug. When a guard comes patrolling near them, Jung-yeon quickly rolls Woo-jin on top of her to keep them out of sight. But even after the guard passes, Woo-jin doesn\\u2019t get off, and she becomes alarmed for a moment. Rather than having bad intentions, he picks something off her neck. It\\u2019s the blue bug from before, which they take to the school lab to analyze. Woo-jin cuts it open, and a green pus oozes out. In the middle of the bug\\u2019s abdomen, there\\u2019s a small microchip embedded, and they realize that this is the reason the students were dying. They research on the web, but they can\\u2019t find any details on microrobots.  Woo-jin and Jung-yeon share a sweet moment as he worries for her because she doesn\\u2019t seem to sleep and keeps drinking coffee, and in reply, she places a bandaid on his cut. When they leave the library, it\\u2019s already the next day, and Jung-yeon has to make an excuse for not having come home to her father. When he\\u2019s relaxing back at home, Woo-jin can\\u2019t seem to get Bum-gyun\\u2019s last words about the \\u201cbluebird\\u201d out of his head, and when he glances at the post-it that Jung-yeon first gave him at their initial meeting, something clicks. He immediately runs to her private dormitory, but she\\u2019s not home.  He asks to wait in her room, and once the door shuts behind him, he begins searching through all her things. At the windowsill, he discovers a pot covered by a book, and underneath it, he finds a living blue bug crawling in the dirt. Now we see that her post-it had contained her email address, bluebird97@holust.ac.kr. The shot quickly jumps to Jung-yeon, who faces the same abandoned building that Bum-gyun had been in front of before he disappeared. We also see glimpses of Bum-gyun confined in a dark cellar, banging on doors and yelling for a way out.  Part 2: Brave New World Joon-hyuk wakes up in pain in Ho-soo\\u2019s pristine white apartment, which is when he receives a call from Dong-soo saying that his systems were hacked by the mythical \\u201cBluebird.\\u201d Joon-hyuk tells him to forget about Bluebird for a second so that he can concentrate on a different lead. Ho-soo returns to his apartment to find Joon-hyuk making a mess in his living room, since he\\u2019s kneading dough for breakfast croissants. They have a little back-and-forth as they disagree on food tastes, reaffirming their dislike of each other. (Aww, what a cute couple.)  Later, Joon-hyuk reviews case notes, concentrating on the information on Park Jin-gyu, Min-ji\\u2019s foster father. Joon-hyuk wants to access Jin-gyu\\u2019s memories to check what happened on the day of her kidnapping, but when he brings up that he\\u2019ll be doing the check on Ordinary Earth, Ho-soo violently protests, saying that it\\u2019s illegal to access Human B systems on Ordinary Earth. Joon-hyuk is suspicious of the organization\\u2019s motives and believes that the data will be uncorrupted if extracted on Ordinary Earth. Displeased, Ho-soo reports directly to the mayor, who asks him if the idea of Human B tampering with people\\u2019s memories could be a possibility. Ho-soo vehemently disagrees with Joon-hyuk\\u2019s suppositions, but complies with the mayor\\u2019s request to just keep an eye on the detective. As an elected official with the trust of all the city\\u2019s citizens, the mayor says that he will allow Joon-hyuk to go about the case in his own way, because he acknowledges that Human B\\u2014no matter how great it seems to be\\u2014is still a corporation with its own interests at heart.  As he leaves the room, Ho-soo experiences a headache that\\u2019s accompanied by auditory hallucinations of a woman calling his voice. But he quickly calms down through the help of his implanted Stable Care chip. Joon-hyuk and Ho-soo meet at the hospital where Park Jin-gyu is recovering from the injuries that a rogue Min-ji gave him. Joon-hyuk confronts the foster father with a tape recording of his own voice on the day of the kidnapping, where he called 911 to report Min-ji\\u2019s case.  Joon-hyuk keeps accusing him of being a murderer, and the man, despite being a Smart Earth citizen with the implanted Care Chip, raises his voice and becomes visibly angry. After he calms down, he agrees to do anything that will restore his precious Min-ji back to him, and so Joon-hyuk and Ho-soo procure the agreement necessary to extract Park Jin-gyu\\u2019s memories on Ordinary Earth. Deputy Chief Lee and his second-in-command, Secretary Shin, meet to discuss the new strides that Joon-hyuk has been making in discovering Human B insider secrets. Back on Ordinary Earth, Dong-soo prepares to extract the memories from Park Ji-gyu and explains the process to Detective Oh, even though he thinks he\\u2019s too stupid to understand. Chief Hong steps in and starts spewing complicated technical jargon about the process, and apparently, it\\u2019s all correct because Dong-soo\\u2019s jaw drops.  Joon-hyuk meets a lady in front of the building, and it\\u2019s revealed that she\\u2019s the doctor who will be performing the operation necessary to access the Care Chip embedded in Park Jin-gyu\\u2019s head. Once Dong-soo hooks up to the Care Chip system, the servers on Human B are notified of the breach, and Deputy Chief Lee tells Secretary Shin to take care of it by any means necessary. She brings a squad of goons to the building where Joon-hyuk & Co. are extracting Jin-gyu\\u2019s memories. A fight breaks out between Chief Hong\\u2019s cops and Human B goons until Joon-hyuk comes out and freezes the crowd by shooting bullets into the air. He aims the handgun at Secretary Shin, who tells him that his actions to extract Park Jin-gyu\\u2019s memories are a clear violation of intellectual property laws.  He tells her to report it to the police\\u2014but oops, he is the police, so he tells her under no uncertain terms that he\\u2019ll welcome Human B\\u2019s request for an investigation because that means that he\\u2019ll have access to all their information as part of law enforcement. Otherwise, it\\u2019d be obstruction of justice. Thus, while staring daggers at Joon-hyuk, she leaves after calling the Human B deputy chief, who tells her to leave without creating a more of a fuss. After some battling with Human B\\u2019s security firewall, Dong-soo almost breaks through. But suddenly, Bluebird\\u2019s signature pops up again, showing that the hacker is on Human B\\u2019s team. Frustrated by the lack of progress, Joon-hyuk just rushes out with no plan and only his gun to confront Human B for tampering with people\\u2019s memories. Chief Hong follows him out and literally knocks some sense into him, reminding him that he needs to take logical steps in order to save his brother.  Ho-soo experiences headaches and nosebleeds as well as quick flashbacks of a woman who waves at him in front of a familiar cafe. He begins to think that perhaps Joon-hyuk\\u2019s suspicions may be right, and if so, these flashes may be memories returning to him. The doctor bandages up Joon-hyuk\\u2019s cut and asks him if he really can\\u2019t forget everything and live his life as he is now. Joon-hyuk replies that he\\u2019s doing this so that he can do exactly that: forget. He stands up to leave and reminds her to eat more, and the scene is strangely reminiscent of Woo-jin telling Jung-yeon to get more sleep earlier on. (Is this a hint? Or a misdirect?)  Ho-soo goes to the cafe where he remembers seeing the flashes of the mystery woman. When he sits at the same table his forgotten memories point him to, he shakes with the stress of returning emotions, until his eyes land on a board full of photos. To his shock, he spots a shot taken of him with his arm around the woman from his memories. Finally, it comes flooding back to him\\u2014she tied his tie for him here, smiling at him with adoration. The cafe owner greets him, saying that it\\u2019s been a while since she\\u2019s seen him, and she confirms that the woman in the picture was his girlfriend, who passed away a long time ago. He can only stumble outside, half-laughing, half-crying with grief and bewilderment.  Meanwhile, back at Ordinary Earth Team HQ, Dong-soo works for hours trying to hack the Human B system. He\\u2019s about to give up when he finally breaks through and discovers Bluebird\\u2019s whereabouts. Using GPS, he\\u2019s able to track Bluebird, and Joon-hyuk rushes out to track the hacker by car while Dong-soo guides him. But suddenly, the entire system stops, and thinking it\\u2019s a power failure, Dectective Oh goes downstairs to the master switch box only to find that Ho-soo was the one who pulled the cord. When Joon-hyuk comes back, he drags Ho-soo outside to demand answers. Overwhelmed, he pushes the Smart Earth official against the wall and shouts that Human B is fooling them all by messing with their memories.  A conflicted Ho-soo replies that if having no memories makes someone happy, isn\\u2019t that all that matters? Joon-hyuk disagrees, saying that when you no longer have memories, you are no longer yourself. Ho-soo reveals that he\\u2019s afraid of his memories coming back, and Joon-hyuk also reveals that he doesn\\u2019t know who he is because he\\u2019s an amnesiac. In a flashback, we see that when he first woke up in the hospital, Chief Hong had showed him a video of the two twins, one of which could be him, and told him that from on, his new name would be Kim Joon-hyuk.So, this is what it\\u2019s like to have your expectations exceeded\\u2026 and then blown away. Circle is a science fiction thriller out of my dreams, and the storytelling is so confident that I\\u2019m instantly reassured. This tale is less about aliens as we think of them \\u2014 UFOs and long-limbed humanoids \\u2014 and more about the consequences of freely giving up a part of yourself so that you can live without pain and misery. Who would refuse such a gift? But the show seems to be asking us: Is it such a blessing after all?  EPISODE 2 RECAP  Some time after they first met the alien, little Woo-jin, Bum-gyun, and their dad sat in a restaurant with their extraterrestrial guest. It was the boys\\u2019 birthday, and a waitress had taken a Polaroid picture of the boys with the unsmiling young woman. Seeing his brother\\u2019s excitement at having a picture to show his friends, Bum-gyun had stressed that she\\u2019s not an alien, though Woo-jin remained convinced. Their dad had simply said that it would be nice if she told them something about herself, but the woman continued to study the view outside in silence. Nothing about her expression changed, but when Woo-jin turned to look in the same direction, his own eyes widened as he spotted a car racing straight towards the glass wall of the restaurant.  At the last moment, Dad glimpsed the car and pulled Bum-gyun to safety, but there was no time to reach Woo-jin on the other side of the table. The car plunged through the glass, crashing into tables, and finally came to a stop. Dad jumped up to look for Woo-jin and found him safely held in a protective embrace by the woman. With trembling hands, Woo-jin pointed out the blood on the woman, and his dad finally registered the large shard of glass sticking out of her neck, though she had no reaction whatsoever to it. As Dad hurriedly called for an ambulance, the woman with the emotionless eyes met Woo-jin\\u2019s shocked gaze.  Part 1: Beta Project Ten years later, Woo-jin follows his brother out into the rainy streets as he races off to find the \\u201calien.\\u201d When Bum-gyun comes to a sudden stop, looking riveted, Woo-jin turns to stare across the street at a familiar figure walking towards them. He stands frozen in place as memories of the alien\\u2019s first arrival replay in his mind. There is no doubt that this woman is the same creature. Then, as she takes a walkway and moves away from them, Bum-gyun gives chase. Unfreezing, Woo-jin realizes that his brother is running into speeding traffic with little care for his own safety. Following him across the road, he grabs Bum-gyun, but his brother is too engrossed in his pursuit to pay him any mind. He notices a bus moving away the nearby bus stop and studies the passengers. The woman from their past turns and looks straight at them.  Bum-gyun chases after the bus, but Woo-jin \\u2014 after almost getting run over \\u2014 gives up and watches in frustration as his brother disappears after it. He walks back to Bum-gyun\\u2019s hidey-hole and notes the post-it on the wall under the mugshot of a stereotypical movie alien that says, \\u201cCulprit. Han Jung-yeon = Alien.\\u201d Turning away from the wall map, charting the suicides, he notices a camera stowed with the bedrolls on top of the cupboard. When he examines the pictures in it, they are of the \\u201calien\\u201d woman. But this one is smiling happily with friends in the campus of his college. Woo-jin tries to convince himself that this woman is just a lookalike. Then he gets a call from his brother\\u2019s number, and it turns out that Bum-gyun is in the emergency room with a fractured foot. Woo-jin runs to the hospital, and the first thing his brother asks him is if he saw \\u201cExhibit three\\u2026 the woman from ten years ago.\\u201d  Barely restraining himself in front of the nurse treating Bum-gyun, Woo-jin snarls at him to finish his treatment first. When Bum-gyun brings up the woman again outside, Woo-jin argues that she just looks like the same person. Bum-gyun points out that she ran away when she saw them, convinced that she\\u2019s the one responsible for the deaths of the college students. Woo-jin calls him delusional, but Bum-gyun reminds him that he was the one to first call her an alien. He pushes Woo-jin to acknowledge the truth, but this time Woo-jin looks at him squarely and asks why: \\u201cWhat if that woman is an alien? Why is that my problem?\\u201d Bum-gyun begins to shout that that woman took their father, but Woo-jin cuts him off and asks if anything would change if their dad came back. \\u201cI already feel like I\\u2019m dying dealing with you. But dad too? Why should I?\\u201d Woo-jin asks. Bum-gyun falls silent at the clear desperation in Woo-jin\\u2019s eyes, but he can\\u2019t give in when Woo-jin asks him to forget about their dad and the alien and just live normally.  Bum-gyun walks away, saying that he has to confirm it with his own eyes. Watching his brother leave, Woo-jin shouts out a final ultimatum: \\u201cIf you walk away now, I\\u2019ll never see you again.\\u201d Bum-gyun pauses at this, but after squaring his shoulders, he keeps walking. Behind him, Woo-jin looks crestfallen, until he too walks away in the other direction. When he gets back home, Woo-jin packs up his brother\\u2019s bag and throws it out in the hallway. Slamming the door shut, he tells himself: \\u201cThere are no such things as aliens.\\u201d The next morning, the bag is still sitting outside, but Woo-jin has to run to his college and apologize to Professor Park for missing their meeting the day before. The professor seems keenly interested in Woo-jin\\u2019s reasons for wanting to join their PTSD Research Team.  He asks Woo-jin which of the current treatments for PTSD is most effective, in his opinion. Woo-jin answers that he thinks none of them are \\u2014 since traumatic memories remain untouched by the normal curve of human forgetfulness, people can never forget the pain and horror of the experience. His solution is to eliminate the memory completely, much like one eliminates cancer cells. On his way out of the building, Woo-jin spots the woman from last night crossing the campus grounds. He chases after her, but soon loses sight of her. During his next class, as he tries to convince himself that he had been mistaken, his professor teams the students up in pairs to study. His partner gets a sudden nosebleed and has to leave the classroom, but moments later, another girl walks in and introduces herself as HAN JUNG-YEON. Woo-jin\\u2019s mind flashes back to the post-it in his brother\\u2019s motel room, and he slowly looks back at the alien he remembers from his childhood. As she walks towards him, he can\\u2019t stop staring. She takes a seat beside him, and the professor outlines their next assignment.  Jung-yeon brings up branches of data-mining they can work on, just as if she were a real college kid sitting beside a new partner in class. Woo-jin\\u2019s response is to bluntly ask her name, origin, and age. Jung-yeon visibly bristles at his rudeness, until the professor snaps at them to pay attention. Outside the class, Jung-yeon strides up to him (while Woo-jin stumbles back a few steps) and asks for his phone. Putting her number in, she tells him to meet her in the library at six to work on their assignment. Then, she walks away with her friends, just like a normal college kid. Woo-jin watches her leave with a frown. Later, he sits at a cafe with his student \\u2014 a school-aged Lee Dong-soo \\u2014 while distractedly playing with a Rubik\\u2019s cube. When he gets a text from Jung-yeon about their meeting, Dong-soo sniggers that he\\u2019s got a girlfriend. He tries to cut their study session short by claiming that he\\u2019ll succeed by using his computer skills anyway, but Woo-jin gets him to focus by pinching his eyebrow. (Ouch.)  At the library, Woo-jin sits across from Jung-yeon while they work. She catches him staring a few times, and Woo-jin tries to cut it out, until he remembers the glass shard in the woman\\u2019s neck from ten years ago. Jung-yeon\\u2019s hair is down, but Woo-jin tries to get a glimpse of the skin there in order to check for a scar. This is simultaneously nerve-wracking and hilarious, since Woo-jin looks utterly embarrassed at his actions, despite being unable to stop his curiosity. He fails, but when Jung-yeon gets a call and leaves early, he decides to follow her. She goes into a local bar and greets a group of young boys in army uniforms like a friend. As Woo-jin watches from across the room, they challenge her to chug a tumbler of beer, and she braces for this by tying up her hair. Woo-jin sits up and finally gets to see\\u2026 completely unmarred skin where a deep scar should be. Laughing at himself for thinking she was an alien, he gets up and leaves.  A younger Chief Hong, still a detective, is busy sketching the perpetrator of the serial college suicides \\u2014 only his sketch has no face, just a cap pulled low over the eyes. His partner hands him the file of all criminals caught using a taser, then grumbles to another cop that when Chief Hong gets a hunch about someone\\u2019s guilt, they always turn out to be innocent. At his desk, Chief Hong pulls out Bum-gyun\\u2019s sheet from the file and places it beside his own sketch. When Woo-jin gets home, he finds Bum-gyun\\u2019s bag still sitting out in the hallway. He picks it up and brings it in, then rings up his brother. Bum-gyun\\u2019s voice sounds hushed as he says that he thinks he\\u2019s found the alien\\u2019s hideout. Woo-jin tries to tell him about the woman, but Bum-gyun suddenly says, \\u201cThe criminal is Bluebird!\\u201d Woo-jin tells him to come home and tell him about this Bluebird, and Bum-gyun promises to come over right after he checks something. But the next morning arrives with no sign of Bum-gyun \\u2014 his phone\\u2019s switched off and his boss at the bakery hasn\\u2019t seen him after his first day at work.  Chief Hong arrives with his partner at the bakery too, and after speaking to the boss, he decides that Bum-gyun is the man with the taser. Woo-jin visits his brother\\u2019s motel room and faces an irate owner, who says that Bum-gyun was supposed to pay his dues that day. Before leaving, he notices a map stuck to the wall with \\u201calien\\u2019s hideout\\u201d written on it. He takes the map and runs to the location. It\\u2019s a PC gaming den, and there is no sign of his brother among the gamers. The other thing he remembers from the wall is another post-it note about the library, and runs there only to find Jung-yeon studying by herself. He walks up to her and begins to ask a question before changing his mind and running out.  Back at the motel, he remembers the camera and pulls it down from its place on top of the cupboard. The recording in it shows Bum-gyun placing it there and leaving it on as he switches off the light and leaves the room. Woo-jin almost groans, until he fast forwards a little to see a hooded figure enter the room and switch on the light. The person scans Bum-gyun\\u2019s wall, then turns to leave. At the last moment, the figure looks towards the camera, and Woo-jin jerks back when he sees Jung-yeon\\u2019s face. He immediately goes back to the library and waits for her outside. When she sees him and asks why they keep bumping into each other, he walks up to her and asks if she\\u2019s really Han Jung-yeon. He grabs her by her collar, and in the face of her seemingly genuine outrage, he yells: \\u201cWho are you? Who the hell are you?\\u201d  Part 2: Brave New World Finally in Smart Earth, Joon-hyuk stands outside the imposing building housing the Human B control room. He glances down at the Rubik\\u2019s cube in his hand and thinks, Wait for me. I\\u2019ll find you, wherever you may be. He watches as a few smartly dressed people enter the building, led by Deputy Chief LEE HYUN-SEOK (Min Sung-wook). Deputy Chief Lee walks into the control room, where dozens of employees monitor live feeds of their Smart Earth citizens. He asks the men in charge of the Stable Care chip and software how the murder could have happened. Each man tries to push the blame on the other department while claiming  that neither the chip nor the software could be at fault. He tells them to find the cause fast and keep silent about the murder. SECRETARY SHIN, his second-in-command, informs him that Mayor Yoon wants to meet him.  In Mayor Yoon\\u2019s office, Ho-soo reports on the background of the murder. The murdered man, Gong Min-woo, had kidnapped a seven-year-old Kim Min-ji twenty years ago, but got away due to lack of evidence. Mayor Yoon asks about Min-ji\\u2019s location, but Ho-soo says that the Human B system can\\u2019t locate her. The mayor orders Ho-soo to report to him directly and to also keep an eye on Joon-hyuk during the investigation. The mayor next meets the deputy chief and asks how such a crime is possible under the Stable Care System. Instead of answering, Deputy Chief Lee asks if he had to go to the extreme length of allowing an unchipped detective into their city: \\u201cYou\\u2019ve planted a bomb in Smart Earth.\\u201d Mayor Yoon doesn\\u2019t back down, retorting that the bomb is already on the loose. Deputy Chief Lee brings up an elusive \\u201cchairman,\\u201d and the mayor cuts him off to ask if the man even exists. The deputy chief avoids the question and stresses that the chairman finds Joon-hyuk\\u2019s presence in Smart Earth unfortunate, but the mayor confidently assures him that the Ordinary Earth detective will solve the case.  Unsurprisingly, Deputy Chief Lee looks into Joon-hyuk, and Secretary Shin tells him that the detective didn\\u2019t exist on paper until ten years ago, when he joined the police force. He guesses that this was the reason he refused to have a chip inserted in his head, and Secretary Shin adds that he probably came here with another motive. Chief Hong and Joon-hyuk meet in the white space of virtual reality, and the chief immediately rags on him for looking like he just rolled out of bed. Joon-hyuk says that things are crazy because of the care chip and asks Chief Hong how a chip could keep crimes for happening for  five thousand days. \\u201cThat chip definitely has a purpose we don\\u2019t know about,\\u201d Joon-hyuk stresses. Chief Hong says that this would mean that the Human B program was responsible for the disappearance of the twins. Joon-hyuk agrees: \\u201cIf it weren\\u2019t for that child, this chip wouldn\\u2019t exist.\\u201d Chief Hong tells him not to get caught, since his identity could bring everything down.  Finishing the call, Joon-hyuk takes out a notebook and scribbles in it. Ho-soo walks into his apartment (he really likes white) and finds his guest sprawled on the couch with food and clothes strewn about. He passive-aggressively remarks on the talent it takes to be this untidy in so short a time. As he picks up the clothes, Joon-hyuk adds his socks to the load with a smile. Ho-soo comments on his backward habit of writing in a notebook, and Joon-hyuk snarks that the analog process gives him a clarity Ho-soo wouldn\\u2019t understand. Ho-soo says that they have to go to a place that is far from analog, and they take a trip to Smart Earth\\u2019s investigation lab, buried deep underground. As they take yet another flight of stairs, Joon-hyuk calls Ho-soo \\u201cErro,\\u201d explaining that his plastic smile reminds him of the pantomime character, \\u201cPierrot.\\u201d  As they walk into the lab, Ho-soo seriously explains that they have to keep their investigation hushed. Joon-hyuk takes another shot at Ho-soo by claiming to be surprised that the care chip lets him stop smiling. Ho-soo patiently explains that the stable care system only controls emotions to prevent misery and crime. Joon-hyuk wonders exactly what needs to happen for the care system to step in, and Ho-soo says that it intercepts excessive emotions like over-excitement, sudden surprise, or anger. Joon-hyuk nods along as he circles Ho-soo, then abruptly grabs him around the neck and chokes him. He lets him go when Ho-soo\\u2019s chip doesn\\u2019t light up in his neck. As Ho-soo readjusts his suit, Joon-hyuk tries another attack \\u2014 this time, with the picture of a woman in a bikini on his phone.  As Ho-soo blinks in confusion, Joon-hyuk look downward and wonders if the care system controls that function too. Ho-soo almost rolls his eyes at Joon-hyuk\\u2019s immaturity. Joon-hyuk finally gets serious and asks to see Gong Min-woo\\u2019s body. When they visit the morgue, and he pulls out the drawer with the dead body, Joon-hyuk finally gets the answer he wanted from Ho-soo. The younger man reacts badly to his first glimpse of a corpse and runs out of the room. As he hyperventilates in the hallway, the care system stabilizes his vital stats so that he can calm down. Joon-hyuk comes out and asks if this is the first body he\\u2019d seen. He tells Ho-soo that he\\u2019d thrown up after his own first glimpse of a corpse, but Ho-soo doesn\\u2019t see why he has to be like Joon-hyuk and says that it\\u2019s rational to avoid harmful human emotions.  When Joon-hyuk wonders if rationality is all that matters, Ho-soo claims that it has kept their city free of crime for fifteen years now. Joon-hyuk scoffs and asks if he really thinks that\\u2019s true. As Ho-soo spouts the Stable Care maxim with conviction, Joon-hyuk just says, \\u201cIgnorance is bliss.\\u201d Ho-soo is utterly thrown by the idea that there is something he doesn\\u2019t know. Back inside the room, the two look over the body. There is a \\u201cNo. 1\\u201d etched into the dead man\\u2019s forehead, which prompts Ho-soo to wonder if this is only the first murder. Joon-hyuk recalls Min-ji\\u2019s call, where she had said, \\u201cThose guys are back.\\u201d He deduces that there could have been accomplices in the kidnapping. As they examine the body further, they find a slit on the side of his neck and realize that someone has taken out the dead man\\u2019s chip. Joon-hyuk immediately heads to the office of the doctor who performed the autopsy, with Ho-soo at his heels. He confronts the woman for damaging the evidence and demands the chip back.  She hands it over easily, saying that she was following protocol, but Joon-hyuk is clearly not satisfied. He waits in the car in the parking lot below, while refusing to answer Ho-soo\\u2019s questions. As Ho-soo gets a call and steps out to take it, Joon-hyuk notices the doctor getting into her own car. He immediately drives off after her, leaving Ho-soo yelling after him. The doctor meets Secretary Shin and hands over the real chip. Secretary Shin says that Joon-hyuk couldn\\u2019t have accessed the information without the Human B software anyway. As Shin takes the chip, a hand grabs her wrist. \\u201cThis is evidence in a criminal investigation,\\u201d Joon-hyuk tells her. \\u201cWho told you to do it?\\u201d Secretary Shin takes him to the Human B building, where a company of guards immediately blocks his way. Deputy Chief Lee walks down the stairs, and with a cold look towards his secretary, he introduces himself. Joon-hyuk shows him the chip and asks if its unauthorized removal was his doing.  When he feigns ignorance, Joon-hyuk asks to see the chairman, since it could only be on his order, then. The deputy chief tells him that the chairman doesn\\u2019t see outsiders, but Joon-hyuk brings the book down on them by quoting the law that entitles him to arrest the chairman for forging evidence. Deputy Chief Lee immediately claims it was a mistake and promises full cooperation in the future. He extends a hand to Joon-hyuk, which the detective ignores and walks out. Secretary Shin steps forward, shamefaced, as Deputy Chief Lee clenches his fist. Joon-hyuk makes a virtual reality call to Chief Hong and shows him the chip he confiscated. He directs the chief to quickly arrest Lee Dong-soo so that they can crack the secrets of the chip.  Dong-soo is up to his usual swindling in a bar when Detective Ho and Chief Hong arrive on the scene. They arrest him by clapping an electronic anklet on his leg, all the while bantering with him like old friends. Dong-soo is brought to the gateway to Smart Earth, where Joon-hyuk hands him the chip. He tells the hacker to analyze it, which frustrates Dong-soo, since he\\u2019s a software hacker and the chip is a piece of hardware. Getting increasingly worked up, he shouts that the chip only connects the brain to the Human B software, but holds no data in itself. Asking if the Bluebird can do it, Joon-hyuk directs Dong-soo to find the legendary hacker in five days. Dong-soo tells him that it\\u2019s impossible, but Joon-hyuk clearly has him cornered. Later, when Dong-soo sits in his lair, stewing in frustration, his monitor lights up with Bluebird\\u2019s logo.  Back in Smart Earth, Ho-soo confronts Joon-hyuk about his behavior. Joon-hyuk asks if Ho-soo knew about Human B\\u2019s forging of the chip, adding, \\u201cI can\\u2019t trust you people.\\u201d Ho-soo shoots back that he can\\u2019t trust Joon-hyuk. \\u201cDetective Kim, why did you come to Smart Earth?\\u201d Joon-hyuk claims that he\\u2019s there to solve the murder, but Ho-soo points out that instead of looking for Min-ji, he\\u2019s been entirely focused on Gong Min-woo\\u2019s chip. He warns Joon-hyuk to behave himself, or he\\u2019ll be thrown out of Smart Earth. Just then, both men get an alert on their phones: Min-ji\\u2019s chip has come online. They race to the location, but just then, the chip vanishes from the system again. They find a man bleeding from a stab wound in an apartment, and while Joon-hyuk tries to stem the blood, Ho-soo freezes at the sight. Joon-hyuk yells at him to call an ambulance, but Ho-soo can only move once his chip\\u2019s light changes to green.  Min-ji\\u2019s second victim (with a \\u201cNo.2\\u201d etched on his forehead) survives, but claims to have been a loving uncle to his friend\\u2019s daughter. Ho-soo reports the man\\u2019s name and residence to Joon-hyuk, who notes it in his book. The man is Min-ji\\u2019s legal guardian, and he tells his visitors that Min-ji had been behaving strangely for the past few days. Ho-soo asks if he has any memory footage they can examine, and Joon-hyuk is surprised to learn that people can download their memories and store them. In the uncle\\u2019s memory, Min-ji speaks about remembering being kidnapped as a child. The uncle\\u2019s voice tells her that she\\u2019s never been kidnapped, and Min-ji agrees, except the memories are becoming more and more vivid. Ho-soo turns to Joon-hyuk and asks why everyone keeps saying she had never been kidnapped when it was a fact of her past. Joon-hyuk slowly says that her lost memories were returning to her. Ho-soo wonders how she lost them: Stress? Mental trauma? Joon-hyuk shakes his head and says, \\u201cNo. It was because of Smart Earth.\\u201d  Later, Joon-hyuk walks out of the shower with an aching head. He takes a pill out of a bottle and clears the fogged mirror. He pushes away the hair from his left ear and examines a scar there. It\\u2019s eerily similar to the one on the dead man\\u2019s corpse. Memories from twenty years ago rush in as he stands there clutching his head. Woo-jin pleads with someone to find his brother. \\u201cI don\\u2019t care if he ends up in the hospital or jail, so please\\u2026!\\u201d There are fragments of memories where Bum-gyun bangs on a door, where Woo-jin runs after a car while a bloody hand presses against the window, and where a hooded figure walks away from Woo-jin. The final, most vivid memory is of Woo-jin sitting in the police station, begging to have his brother found. Joon-hyuk shuts his eyes against the flood of these images.  Deputy Chief Lee rides in an elevator alone and ascends to the penthouse where \\u201cthe chairman\\u201d resides. The man sits in a deep armchair, with his back to the room. As the deputy chief walks into the room, he finds the chairman watching Kim-ji\\u2019s memories of being kidnapped as a child. The deputy chief promises to get rid of the memory from the system before Joon-hyuk finds out about it. He asks the chairman why he halted their investigation into Joon-hyuk, who clearly forged his identity and has something to hide. We don\\u2019t hear an answer, but Lee says that he understands. As he turns to leave, a thought stops Deputy Chief Lee. \\u201cPerhaps\\u2026 you already know who he is?\\u201d The chairman doesn\\u2019t turn around, but one gloved hand extends to show him a picture on an old phone. From it, the twin brothers look out at us, and it\\u2019s the picture Bum-gyun had taken with his phone back in 2017.Circle began with a literal bang this week, and after months of trying to find a fix for my drama slump, I\\u2019m almost hyperventilating at how good it is so far. I was nervous because I didn\\u2019t know whether the two timelines would mesh, or whether the whole dystopian future would be executed well. But, almost everything, from the fast pacing to the rich background stories to the high-quality acting, is on point. So without further ado, I give you Circle.  EPISODE 1 RECAP  Part 1: Beta Project In the year 2007, two young children walk alone in the woods with a bike between them, moonlight guiding their way through the dark. The younger brother asks his older sibling: \\u201cHow did you find me? Twin telepathy?\\u201d The older brother scoffs at the idea and tells his younger brother not to go wandering off into the mountains anymore. The younger twin, KIM WOO-JIN, keeps telling his older brother, KIM BUM-GYUN, that this time, he\\u2019s sure: He\\u2019s convinced that aliens and UFOs are real. Bum-gyun asks for evidence, and Woo-jin is happy to oblige: Exhibit #1 is the fog, but the older brother explains it away by temperature difference. Exhibit #2 is a burnt pine cone, but this is similarly explained away by the presence of local lumberjacks who also work in the area.  Suddenly, a white light beams from the sky, seeming to chase them menacingly. They get on bike to flee, but it keeps following them. Faster and faster, Bum-gyun pedals as streetlights burst when they pass along the street. A truck almost runs into them because of the bright light, but it misses them by a hair and crashes. The bike falls when a light from the other direction comes toward them \\u2014 but it\\u2019s the headlight of a car that stops in front of them. It\\u2019s their father, KIM KYU-CHUL (Kim Joong-ki), who comes out of the vehicle, and he runs to save them from the strange bright light.  After the ball of light descends from the sky, a huge supernova-like blast occurs, blinding the family trio. When they finally open their eyes, they see that the light contains a humanoid figure. And as it materializes, it crystallizes into a naked human female form (Gong Seung-yeon). She walks toward them, and Woo-jin says that his final evidence is \\u201cExhibit #3: an alien.\\u201d She collapses, and he approaches her fallen form as his father and his twin call him back.  Ten years later, a college-age Kim Woo-jin (Yeo Jin-gu) walks past the crowd of protesting Handam Science and Technology University students while another classmate calls after him. He ignores the calls and makes his way to a classroom where only he and Professor PARK DONG-GUN (Han Sang-jin) are present, and he proceeds to take an exam. As soon as he walks out, he\\u2019s confronted by his some other classmates, who heckle him for not upholding their boycott of the exam. The boycott was to show\\xa0support for the protest that\\u2019s happening outside to urge the school\\u2019s president to step down for condoning brutal academic competition and fostering a harsh learning environment.  However, Woo-jin isn\\u2019t having any of it, because as a scholarship student, he needs to stay at the top of the class to maintain his free tuition. So he sarcastically quips back a thanks for an easy first place exam when the others try to make him feel bad for his choice to take it. As he leaves them, a phone call from his grandmother\\u2019s hospice reminds him that he\\u2019s late on this month\\u2019s payment. We next see him adjusting his makeup in a mirror, since it turns out that he\\u2019s working a part-time job as a female ghost in a haunted house. He scares one child who begins to cry, and immediately feeling guilty for scaring him, Woo-jin begins making funny faces with two lollipops. But this only serves to make the elementary schooler cry harder, and so Woo-jin gives him both candies as he scientifically explains the fear of supernatural entities away.  Later, while eating his dinner of instant ramen noodles alone, he receives a text that his sunbae, Ji-hyuk, is dead. His group chat log becomes inundated with messages like \\u201cRIP Ji-hyuk\\u201d and \\u201cYou will be missed.\\u201d But Woo-jin has only one thing on his mind. The following morning, he goes to Professor Park\\u2019s lab (where Ji-hyuk had been working before his untimely death) and asks if the professor is picking a new research assistant. Woo-jin offers his candidacy, and the professor, glancing at the mementos still piling on the late Ji-hyuk\\u2019s desk, is shocked and taken aback by Woo-jin\\u2019s request. He tells him so, and Woo-jin understand, but he re-emphasizes that he wanted to be considered before any other student was in the running.  A sunbae who had been watching this entire situation unfold with outraged disbelief corners Woo-jin as he leaves the lab for being so insensitive about Ji-hyuk\\u2019s death. He pushes Woo-jin against the wall and tells him that it was mercenary academics like him who caused Ji-hyuk to commit suicide. However, Woo-jin doesn\\u2019t just take this sort of condemnation and fires back at the sunbae: \\u201cDo you think the world is so easy? Because you\\u2019ve lived your entire life privileged, you took advantage of Ji-hyuk too, taking credit while he did all the work. Isn\\u2019t it too late to pretend to be a good guy?\\u201d  Woo-jin pushes past the sunbae, but in an attempt to rile him up and get the last word in, the sunbae asks about Woo-jin\\u2019s older brother, Bum-gyun (Ahn Woo-yeon). That makes Woo-jin stop, and his mind goes back to a flashback to his high school days where he went to the police station to see his brother in handcuffs. Turning around, Woo-jin replies to his sunbae that his brother is still in prison, and he adds that if they do end up working together in Professor Park\\u2019s lab, he won\\u2019t be able to take advantage of him as easily as he did Ji-hyuk.  As Woo-jin is about to leave campus grounds, he passes by the memorial for Ji-hyuk and overhears the detectives talking to a student who had witnessed Ji-hyuk\\u2019s last moments. The witness tells the cops about a boy with a taser who was seen with Ji-hyuk before he died, and this makes Woo-jin remember that Bum-gyun had always reminded him to carry a taser in case of another alien attack. This prompts him to go to the rooftop, where another memory surfaces of Bum-gyun threatening a female student with the taser, accusing her of being the alien. Back in the present, Woo-jin looks down toward the memorial from the rooftop, and he sees a figure wearing a black cap, and the figure clearly reminds him of his brother. He runs down several flights of stairs to catch the figure, but when he finally gets there, the figure is gone.  He comes home to see a pair of shoes that aren\\u2019t his own, so he glances around, and his brother comes out of the bathroom with a huge grin on his face. Woo-jin asks suspiciously how Bum-gyun got out so early, and his older brother explains that while Woo-jin may be a model student, he was a model prisoner, which earned him an early parole release. A little suspicious, Woo-jin asks whether it was his first day out and whether he visited Handam University, but Bum-gyun replies that he rushed home straightaway. They exchange happy greetings in brotherly fashion, with good ol\\u2019 chokeholds and wrestling.  They go out to eat chicken, and Woo-jin watches his brother down the fried meat at an unbelievably rapid pace. Bum-gyun tells him about the chicken dreams he had while he had been locked up before he gets distracted by a spam text. When Woo-jin asks where he got the phone from, Bum-gyun avoids the question and just says he procured one. It\\u2019s not a big deal because Bum-gyun seems cheerful, and they take selfies together in commemoration of his release from prison. At night, still suspicious of his brother, Woo-jin rummages through Bum-gyun\\u2019s drawers looking for any sign of the taser, but Bum-gyun wakes up and asks him what he\\u2019s doing. Knowing that Woo-jin is worried about his obsession with the alien, Bum-gyun reassures Woo-jin that he\\u2019s gotten over it and won\\u2019t cause any more trouble.  He adds that he\\u2019s even been hired as a pastry chef at a bakery right near Handam University. Woo-jin is surprised but happy to hear the news, and they laugh and wrestle together before going to bed. On his way to school, Woo-jin sees his brother working at the pastry shop through the window and is relieved that Bum-gyun was telling the truth. He reports to Professor Park\\u2019s lab, where he\\u2019s told to wait a moment. But when he looks at all the flowers and photos that have piled up on Ji-hyuk\\u2019s desk, he notices a familiar number on the wall. Typing it into his phone worriedly, Woo-jin realizes that it\\u2019s the same as Bum-gyun\\u2019s new phone number, and so he calls his brother up to ask whether he knows anyone at his school.  When Bum-gyun replies in the negative, Woo-jin becomes even more suspicious, but he tries not to hope for the worst as he asks his older bro when he\\u2019ll be leaving work. Bum-gyun says he\\u2019ll be off at 8:00 p.m., but Woo-jin has been staking out near the bakery and sees his older twin leaving much earlier than he said he would. Woo-jin follows him to a seedy motel and sees him locking up a particular room. Once Bum-gyun\\u2019s gone, Woo-jin breaks the lock with a fire extinguisher and finds that his brother has been up to his regular alien-tracking activities. The entire wall is covered in clues and maps regarding on the alien\\u2019s whereabouts, and when Woo-jin looks through the drawers, he finds the taser. That\\u2019s when Bum-gyun comes in, looking guilty, but when Woo-jin asks him directly if he\\u2019s the one who killed Ji-hyuk, he denies it vehemently and says that it\\u2019s the aliens who took him.  Bum-gyun apologizes for lying to him but insists that he\\u2019s found proof for the existence of aliens, while Woo-jin just looks like tired of this old rhetoric. The older brother brings up their broken family: \\u201dYou know the alien took Dad. Don\\u2019t deny reality.\\u201d However, Woo-jin tells his brother to come back to the real world and face the truth: Their father left them. The scene goes to a flashback where Woo-jin and Bum-gyun watch as their father leaves them behind\\u2026 while in his car, the alien woman sits in his passenger seat. Back in the present, Bum-gyun promises that this time, it\\u2019s for real\\u2014he\\u2019s found the alien hideout, and it\\u2019s on the second floor of the building above his pastry shop (which is why he started working there). Woo-jin, half-knowing that it\\u2019s a wild goose chase, says that this is the last time, and if it\\u2019s not the alien\\u2019s hideout, Bum-gyun will go back to the psychiatric institution.  When they arrive at the second floor alien hideout, it only looks like an abandoned office space. Seeing this, Bum-gyun becomes frantic, looking around everywhere for the alien that isn\\u2019t there. Woo-jin grabs him in a desperate bear hug, pleading with him to please stay by his side and not add to his burdens. But Bum-gyun doesn\\u2019t want to let it go, and in a low moment, he confesses he doesn\\u2019t want to let it go because that would mean he really was crazy for all these years. But then he\\u2019s back on his high and springs out to pursue the alien woman, convinced that they\\u2019re only minutes behind her. As he walks in the rain, Bum-gyun seems fixated on something and shakes his brother off as he tries to pull him back. Woo-jin looks in the direction that Bum-gyun is staring at, and sees Her. On the other side of the crosswalk, the woman who appeared to them from the ball of light walks under a pink umbrella. Bum-gyun points at her, reminiscent of how Woo-jin did ten years ago, and says, \\u201cExhibit #3: an alien.\\u201d  Part 2: Brave New World It\\u2019s 2037, and on Ordinary Earth, dusty yellow smog and pollution is everywhere. The air is so bad that the citizens can\\u2019t breathe without masks. Trash litters the streets, and the condition of living looks squalid to the point of being uninhabitable by most standards. A drone controlled by a man in a red flannel shirt, LEE DONG-SOO (Oh Eui-shik), lands and delivers a USB file. After viewing the racy contents of the USB, the man in the checkered suit next to him compliments Dong-soo on his hacking skills. It looks like this is a shady business deal where the checkered man asked Dong-soo to intercept the USB\\u2019s contents which contained evidence of his extramarital affair before it got to his wife.  A team of cops headed by Chief HONG JIN-HONG (Seo Hyun-chul) arrive on scene and begin pursuing Dong-soo. He\\u2019s at a dead end, but a man wearing a monster mask and a black hoodie comes to save him. The masked man takes the entire team of cops down in an incredible action sequence as Dong-soo watches. When they\\u2019re all knocked down, Dong-soo comes out of his hiding spot to introduce himself, and realizes when the man takes off his mask that it\\u2019s someone that he knows: Detective KIM JOON-HYUK (Kim Kang-woo).  Joon-hyuk drags Dong-soo away, saying that they need to talk, and after they leave the scene, Chief Hong arrives, telling his guys to stop pretending and get up quickly. Grumbling, they take off the protective padding where Joon-hyuk hit them and say that if they have to act this scene one more time with Dong-soo, they\\u2019ll be ready to shoot a Hollywood film. It looks like this was a setup to help Joon-hyuk gain Dong-soo\\u2019s trust by \\u201csaving\\u201d him from the cops. Off in an isolated area, Joon-hyuk wheedles Dong-soo by flattering and coercing him at the same time so that he\\u2019ll hack into the Smart Earth\\u2019s system. However, Dong-soo says that he doesn\\u2019t have the ability to do so, but he gives Joon-hyuk a tip that there is a legend of a hacker, codename Bluebird, who is rumored to either be a super genius human or an AI machine. He may be able to get Joon-hyuk in.  When Joon-hyuk gets back to station, Chief Hong asks how it went, and he confidently says that Dong-soo will do as he\\u2019s told (even though that\\u2019s not exactly what Dong-soo said). Chief Hong mutters under his breath about how if this plan doesn\\u2019t work out, he could get fired, and Joon-hyuk teases that it\\u2019s a good thing the chief has a side job. The younger man playfully threatens to reveal the older man\\u2019s secret identity, and Chief Hong is quick to appease him by telling him that of course they\\u2019ll go along with his plan. Next to them, DETECTIVE OH (Kwon Hyuk-soo) is reading a web comic that he finds fascinating, although he does admit that the ratings are poor. Chief Hong glimpses at the screen and seems pleased, which is when Joon-hyuk reveals just to Detective Oh that the chief is the author of this semi-autobiographical comic. They go out for drinks because Detective Oh is still flabbergasted that the handsome young detective in his favorite comic series is his older superior at work.  At the bar, they talk about the first two major chapters of the comic, with Chief Hong explaining that the first chapter was about the cold case at Handam University (referring to Ji-hyuk\\u2019s death). Though the case was ruled as a suicide, he explains that he suspected it was actually a homicide. In the real-life case behind the second chapter, he actually caught the kidnapper Gong Min-woo of a young girl named Kim Min-ji, but he got away scot-free because of his rich and powerful connections. When Detective Oh asks about the next chapter to be released online, an advertisement hologram announcing the 5000th day of a crime-free Smart Earth pops up. They all groan at the announcement before Detective Oh asks about the third cold case again, and Chief Hong tells him that the third one is based on the case of missing twins. From his pocket, he brings out a crumpled flyer of Woo-jin and Bum-gyun. (Dun dun dun. Did the alien snatch them?)  The following day, Detective Oh receives a call from Smart Earth from a woman who insists that she\\u2019s seven years old and that she has been kidnapped. Thinking that it\\u2019s a prank call (because no crimes are supposed to occur on Smart Earth), Detective Oh hangs up. But Joon-hyuk and Chief Hong\\u2019s senses tingle, and they listen to the recording of the call. In the recording, she introduced herself as Kim Min-ji, and when they run the coordinates, they realize that she\\u2019s the same girl from Chief Hong\\u2019s second chapter of his web comic and that she\\u2019s currently at the house of her kidnapper, Gong Min-woo. Chief Hong and Joon-hyuk rush to the airport to go to Smart Earth, but when they try to barrel through the gates, showing them their police badges, the guards stop them for not having a warrant. A Smart Earth government official named LEE HO-SOO (Lee Ki-kwang) appears when it looks like Chief Hong and Joon-hyuk may be too much for the guards to handle.  Ho-soo takes them to a separate room to discuss the situation, and Joon-hyuk tells him that a kidnapping has occurred on Smart Earth. Ho-soo politely but firmly replies that that isn\\u2019t possible because of its Human B Safety Therapy System. So, Joon-hyuk plays the recording of Kim Min-ji, but Ho-soo brushes it aside as the prank of a hacker. Ho-soo leads them out, but on the way, Joon-hyuk becomes agitated by his complete lack of understanding regarding the need of urgency in case Kim Min-ji really was kidnapped. When Joon-hyuk grabs the Smart Earth man by the collar, the emotional regulation control chip implanted behind his ear starts flashing red, and Ho-soo begins hyperventilating until Joon-hyuk backs off. The chip turns green again, and Ho-soo relaxes back to normal before telling Joon-hyuk to leave. But just as he\\u2019s smiling at Joon-hyuk while telling him to kindly piss off, he receives a Code-0 message on his phone, indicating an emergency situation.  He rapidly turns his back and begins to walk away when Joon-hyuk receives a similar message regarding a death on Smart Earth. Joon-hyuk and Chief Hong, who are being escorted by Smart Earth goons back to the exit, devise a plan so that Joon-hyuk can get to Smart Earth to discover what\\u2019s really going on. Ho-soo receives more information on the Code-0 emergency, and he learns that a murder has happened on Smart Earth, but his higher-ups don\\u2019t want anyone to find out. Joon-hyuk escapes the guards, and seeing Ho-soo walking down a corridor, he backs him forcefully into an empty room and locks the door behind them. Joon-hyuk begins to grill Ho-soo on the case, demanding to know how much Smart Earth has hidden this entire time, and Ho-soo lies about lying by claiming that Smart Earth has never deceived anyone. But, Joon-hyuk calls him out on this baldfaced lie by shoving his face into a clip of Kim Min-ji, a Smart Earth citizen, as she repeatedly stabs Gong Min-woo, her kidnapper and fellow Smart Earth citizen.  A serious discussion is taking place amongst the highest level of Smart Earth government officials, with Mayor YOON HAK-JOO at the head of the table. They want to minimize the bad publicity and realize that they need to shut Joon-hyuk up in order for that to happen. While waiting to holographically meet with Mayor Yoon, Joon-hyuk keeps baiting Ho-soo by taunting him on the artificial nature of his fake smile and his generic white suit. When he puts a special set of glasses on, he\\u2019s faced with Mayor Yoon, who directly tells him that Smart Earth is prepared to give him what he wants if he promises not to spread any rumors regarding the murder. Joon-hyuk replies that he wants to head the investigation of Kim Min-ji\\u2019s case and that he wants the freedom to travel around Smart Earth without having the emotional chip implanted in his brain. When Mayor Yoon says that it\\u2019s not possible because the chip is a requirement for anyone to enter Smart Earth, Joon-hyuk says that rules and patterns have already been broken (via the anomaly of the murder), and he threatens to publicly get a warrant to pursue the case if Yoon doesn\\u2019t comply.  When Joon-hyuk gets back to Chief Hong, the older cop is replaying the clip of the murder, and he confesses to the younger man that he\\u2019s relieved that Kim Min-ji is not the one being murdered. He tells Joon-hyuk to pursue two cases on his visit to Smart Earth: Kim Min-ji\\u2019s case, and the missing twins\\u2019 as well. Joon-hyuk has to leave via an airplane to escape the pollution cloud, and we see that Smart Earth is a utopian island where children play in clean parks and dogs roam freely, completely different from Ordinary Earth\\u2019s current situation. As he arrives on Smart Earth, Joon-hyuk takes out a photograph of young Woo-jin and Bum-gyun smiling next to the expressionless alien woman, and he recalls Chief Hong\\u2019s last words that the answers are on Smart Earth: \\u201cFind your brother.\\u201d'"
